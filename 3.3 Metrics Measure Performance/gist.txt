Metrics Techniques

=> AUC uses ordering of scores

=> Log Loss uses the probability of the scores

=> Distribution of Error (in case of Linear Regression)
    \
     Can use MAD

=> Confusion Matrix gives us idea about how much confused the model is regarding the prediction
   
   Precision Matrix also provides us idea about confusion but more specifically regarding the prediction

   Recall Matrix too provides how confused the Model is regarding the original values
