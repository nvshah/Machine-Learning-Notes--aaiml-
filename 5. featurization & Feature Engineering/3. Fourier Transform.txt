- Repeating Patterns :- Heart rate, Ecommerce Sales

-> Fourier Transform is form of Signal Processing


______________
BuzzWords :- Repeating Waveform, Frequency, Amplitude

* Fourier Transform
  ----------------
   - popular way to represent Time-Series Data
   - used in Image Compression & Signal Compression

> Terminologies :
  --- 
   - Time Period, Frequency
   - Oscillation
   - Amplitude

   Freq = #oscillaations per second  (1 / T)

*  Eg 1 : Human Heart Rate :- 60-100 heart beats(oscillations) per min
            \ 
             Physical & Repeating Phenomenon

   -> Freq & Phase are imp concepts

*  Eg 2 : Ecommerce Sales (Day & Night) - Time-Series 
   
          Pattern - Daily
                  - Weekly
                  - annual patterns  (Eg Big Billion Days, Black Friday Sales)

*[IMP]
=> Whenever there is something repeating or oscillating, first thing to be clicked in mind should be 
   FREQUENCY

* Fourier transform ;

   Core Idea :- If repeating waveform  => the use of frequency is benevolent

   => Fourier Transform is kinda Signal Processing

   - For a given composite wave 
        \
         if its repeating then we can represent that wave as sum of different sin waves
         & this method is known as Fourier Transform

         diff sin waves :- diff freq & amplitude

   -> So via Fourier Transform We can represent Wave in Time-Domain to Freq-Domain

      Note : when something is repeating, Freq is eye-catching term

   > Time to Freq domain conversion :
     ----------
      -> We will have 2 property ie freq & amplitude for each individual sin wave

      & Inorder to represent this in vector form we will Flatten the freq & amplitude in a single vector
       \
        -> [f1, f2, f3, a1, a2, a3]   // 3 freq's followed by correps 3 amplitudes

   * Fourier Representation :
    __________________
   => This way of representing time series data into vector form (freq + amp) is known as Fourier representation 

   => Thus instead of design specia features from domain wxpert via Window
      we will have Freq & amplitude at rescue for vector repr of time series data


* Usecase :- 
  ----
   - FitBit accelerometer (Smart Watch, Smart Phone)

FFT :-

* DC component :-
 ------
  - when sin-wave or any other time-series pattern Wave, is not centered around 0
    then it will have DC-component

    DC-component referes to peak at frequency = 0
