------
=> Decision Tree helps to find the bins in Feature binnning (esp whilst binning real-valued features)

______

 Keys :- { multiple thresolds, multiple buckets }

* Feature Binning
  ------------
   - Logical Extension to Indicator Variable
   
   => have multiple thresolds
   -> Instead of binary values, here we can have multiple features
   -> We pack or bucketize the values into bins

   Binning or Bucketing :
   -----
    -> given real vals for features, we seperate them into buckets or bins

    How to find the correct thresolds ??
     -> Problem-Specific

    - one way to do binning is via domain-knowledge

   Purpose of binning :-
   ----
    -> reframe the feature s.t it solves our task
    => So it makes sense to use Yi's to perform binning on feature

   Finding the thresolds :
   -----
    1 way :- (DT)
    ---
      ( binned the real-val features using Yi's & feature itself, using DT is one such way )
      - You can use DT for (feature, Yi)
      - As DT inherently find the thresolds for split condition

      - Corresponding every leaf node we will have bins as category

    So To binned a real val features :-
      -> binned the real-val features using Yi's & feature itself using DT is one such way
IMP
=> Thus Model need not to be used as just classification algorithm but can also be used for 
   Featurization if used smartly
