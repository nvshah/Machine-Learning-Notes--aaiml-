* Moving Window For Time Series
  ---------

  - one of simplest way of featurizing time series data

  -> Consider eg of ECG

  - Take Some Window of size window-width

  * Signal Processing (Info extraction) : (features study)
    ----
     - Mean, Std-Dev
     - Median, Quantile
     - Max, Min
     - Max - Min
     - Max/Min
     - local maxima
     - Zero Crossing

  => What is right featurization depends very much on problem

  Featurization Steps :
  ------
   1) Window-Width  (decision)

   2) Talk to Domain Expert 
      & decide features that are useful  (from window)

   3) all your features comes from a single window

   NOTE :- window changes often as time passes

==> Deep Learning comes up with learning featurization automatically, fairly successfuly
    Given you have lots of data

Thus there are 2 ways :-
    
    1) Window  (hand-made often by domain expert)
    2) Deep-Learned features
