- BuzzWords :- { Human accoustic, }

--------

- often for time series data we desing special features with help of domain expert
  So 
   feature for Heart-Beat may not work for the Human-Accoustic

- Deep Learning - Lots of data - learn automatically (mostly) the best featurization

* LSTM 
  -----
   - Its a Deep Learning approach
   - When you have lots of data, LSTM is a way to for Featurization almost automatically

   - such features are also known as Deep Learned Features

=> So instead if Hand-Made features nowadays Deep-Learned Features are being used

* Today State-Of-Art :
  ----------------	
   -> is Deep-Learned Features

   When it comes to Image Processing or medical field, Deep Learning has created an Huge Impact
