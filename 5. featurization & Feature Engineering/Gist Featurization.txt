Gist Featurization

=> Business Problem gets converted to ML-problem

-> In ML algo at the end needs to be worked on numerical features ie vectors

So we need the data in some kind of numerical at the end.

-> Featurization is problem & domain specific, You can't cover all thing in one idea
   You need to bring & pick idea as problem demands

So Featurize :
  ------
   -> Simply means to prepare features ready to be used by algo effectively
      (by doing some manipulation on it)

-> Diff types of data :-
     1) Time Series
     2) Image Data
     3) Graph Data
     4) Data in Database Table

* Time Series Data 
  ------- 
   Eg - Heart Beat Rate, Stock Market, ecommerce Sales

   Main Idea :- If Repeating Waveforms alikeness, then use frequency (its benevloent)

   Fourier Transform :- 
      Transform from time domain to freq-domain (ie Vector of freq & amplitude)

   - Window
   - Fourier Transform
   - LSTM

* Image Data 
  ----
   - SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform)
     ----
      -> Key-Points detection for object detection in an image

   - CNN (Convolutional NN)
     ---
      -> Deep Learning Technique

* Relational data :
  ---
   - sQL

* Graph data :
  ----
   - vertex & edges


=> Featurization & Transformation 

- Feature Binning
- Indicator Variable
- Interaction Variable
- Mathematical Transformation

* Models & Suits :
  ------
   > Logistic Reg & Linear Reg :- for linear combinations among features
   > DT/ RF /GB   :- when interactions among features matters

   > very hig dimen :- linear model may works better
                       (as for high dimen #hyperplanes choices improves so linnear model tends better)


=> Models & Featurization are inter-related
