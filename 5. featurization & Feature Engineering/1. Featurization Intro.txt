---------------
-> All ML algo at the end needs & boil down to numerical vector/features 

=> Deep Learning comes up with learning featurization automatically, fairly successfuly
   Given you have lots of data
_______________


* Featurization
 -------------

-> Featurization is one of the way to convert features into numerical vector

- At the end all ML algo mostly can process numerical data

* Eg

  Text Data - BOW, TFIDF, avgW2V, TfidfW2V

  Categorical Data - one-hot encoding, mean-response rate, domain specific
                                       (mean-replicate way)

* Time Series Data :
  ---------------
   - Heart-Rate
   - Ecommerce (product per hour per time)
   - Speech/Text
   - Stock Market Price
   
   convert time-series -> numerical -> ml

* Image Data 
  -------- 
   - XRays, Faces

   convert image -> numerical -> ml


* Data in Database Table :
  ---------------
   - convert it to numerical 

* Graph Data :
  --------
   - Eg recommends a friends on FB
   - edges represent a relation between vertexes
