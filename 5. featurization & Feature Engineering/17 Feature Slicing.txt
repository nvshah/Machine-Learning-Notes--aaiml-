-> When data is imbalanced or there is discrepancy in data, then model will perform
   better on some kind of data than other

   Eg Error on more for people of US  & less on people of India

* Feature Slicing
 --------
  -> this can be used when you have sufficient data for each class label data
     (esp when features have distinctive behaviour to different categories)

  (if you have less pts for particular class than you can't use this kind of technique)

  -> Slicing Idea : train seperate model for each individual category type 
       \
        Slicing the data based on features is called as features slicing
         \
          - conditions :1)- category 1 & category 2 should have diff behaviour
                        2)- must have sufficient number of points for each slices

  => Instead of taking whole data in a big chunk
     its better to break it
        \ 
         - when you have sufficient data
         - when there is different in behaviour between those 2 features
