* Image Histograms

> Images - Objects, Faces, Scans, X-Rays, autonoumous cars

=> Best way to Featurize Image Data is CNN

* Image Histograms :
  ---------
   1) Color Histogram :
      -------
       -> RGB
        steps :- 1) All red vals of each pixel & plot Histogram 
                     \
                      vals range in 0 -> 255

                    -> We can create vector easily from this of length = 255

                 2) similarly do for green & blue 

       thus for an image :- we've 3 vectors of 255 size

       Eg 
       -- 
         1) Sky :- lot of blue pixels
         2) Sunshine :- lot of red color pixels

         3) Face Detection :- lot of skin color pixels

       => Color Histograms cannot determine Shapes 

    2) Edge Histogram ;
      -------
       -> Edge detection is kind part of Image Recognition

       -> Edge can occur in multiple directions

       - So break Image into sub-regions & try to find the angle of edge in those sub-regions

       - then we can plot the histograms for edge-angle/val

=> `Haar` features are one of the advance Image Processing Features


* Featurization technique in brief (for Images) :
  ----------

  - Very Basic & Rudimentary 
    -> Color Histogram
       Edge Histogram

  - Advance 

    -> SIFT (for Object detection)
    -> CNN  (DEEp Learning State of the Art technique)
