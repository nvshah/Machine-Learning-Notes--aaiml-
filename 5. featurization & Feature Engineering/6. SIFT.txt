* SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transforms)
------------
 -> One of the popular technique for Image Featurization

 => It is useful for detecting object from an image

 how ??
   - It detects a key-point (mostly a corners)
     &
     computes 128 dimen vector for each of the key point

 -> SIFT is used in image search

    Eg amazon search any book by uploading image

 * Scale Invariance : (Why ??)
   -----
    -> The Key-Points or features do not change even when scale of images changes 
       (ie image got shrunked or enlarged)
        \
         if image size changes then the key-points for obj in those image will be identified in same way ie key-points are not much affected by the scale of the image (ala scale is reasonable diff by)

   Rotational Invariance :
   ------
    -> key-points/features neither gets affected when image is rotated 

  Invariance = not changed

* property of SIFT :
  ---------------
   1) Scale Invariance
   2) Rotational Invariance

   => The feature computed do not change much whether if image is shrunk in size or rotated slightly

* Compute SIFT features :
  ---------
   -> Can use OpenCV library for Python to compute SIFT features
