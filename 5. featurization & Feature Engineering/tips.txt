tips & facts

-> Read Lots of Literature in ML for understanding Data & finding correct featurization

=> Deep Learning comes up with learning featurization automatically, fairly successfuly
   Given you have lots of data

=> To featurize the Time Series Data we can have 3 ways :
    1) Window   (Hand Made ie specialization)
    2) Fourier transform
    3) Deep Learned   (LSTM)

=> Best way to learn Time Series Data is LSTM
=> Best way to learn the Image Data is CNN Deep Learning Algo

=> Models & Featurization are inter-related

=> You need to understand the domain of task you are trying to solve for.
   because domain based featurization plays imp role
   so spend time reading & learning the domain stuffs & what things already exists
