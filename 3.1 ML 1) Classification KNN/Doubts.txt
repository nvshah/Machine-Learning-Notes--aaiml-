Doubts

Q1) When CV error & Train Error graph is plotted why choose 
      CV accuracy max & Train accuracy min
      instead of
      CV accuracy max & Train accuracy max ??

      How we can argue that K corresp to Train accuracy max is not good for generalization


q2) Does Train Accuracy matters in Choosing K 
    or 
    only CV accuracy only matters ??


QUE

In grid search cv (KNN assignment)

We draw out 2 accuracy score for 2 data ie train & validation

train accuracy

validation accuracy

why we are considering the train accuracy with low val when there is draw for validation accuracy ??

ain't train accuracy high & validation accuracy high be choosen

or

train accuracy low & validation accuracy high should be preferred ?

eg

let say 2 best thresolds are t1 & t2 & need to choose any one from either for K val in KNN during Cross Validation :

 t1 -> train acc = 0.7 & validationn acc = 0.5

 t2 -> train acc = 0.56 & validation acc = 0.5

Which thresold is preferred from t1 or t2 ?

t1 or t2 ??

-> I believe that t1 should be choosen but please explain if its not true !
