Data Understanding & AIm

-> We need probabilities for all classes to understand & interpret in a better way

=> DT, NB, LogReg are easily interpretable
   whereas
   RBF SVM is not easily interpretable

* Performance Metric
  ---------

1) Multi Class Log Loss
-> One of good function to use For Multi-Class Output is Log-Loss function
    \
     because LogLoss uses probability outputs explicitly
     (hence Multi-Class Log-Loss is valid choice)

=> & besides we also want to penalize sligh variation (which can be achieved via LogLoss func)
   \
    -> Even small deviation from Ideal Probability will increase the Loss ie (log Loss)


* Split :
  ----
   -> We want distribution in test, train, CV to be roughly same
