Aim :- Need to find the probability for different classes of Diagnosis

1) Univariate Analysis
    - Feature Stability (how good feature alone work as a Model)

2) Featurization :
->  OneHot Encoding or 
    Response Encoding

3) Modeling (multivariate Analysis)
    - Diff Models Comparision based on performancee
        { Train-Err, Test-Err, Cv-Err, misclassification % }

    - Best founnd was Logistc Regression

NOTE
=> Remember that Cross validation is done for hyper-paramters tuning such 
   but parameters are decided by the train data itself

   CV data acts as a driver to help the model perform better from train data via deciding good parameters
