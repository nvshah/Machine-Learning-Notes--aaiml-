2. EDA & PreProcess

1) Imbalanced Data 

2) Similar Distb

=> When the distribution of classes in Test, Train, CV are roughly same
   then ML works very Well

   If distributions are very diff then ML models will not work very well


* AUC vs LogLoss :
  --------

   => Understanding how random classifier behaves will help us understand how well our fitted model
      behaves relatively well

   In case of AUC we know edge cases so we may not need Random Classifer

   but In case of log Loss we do not know abt upper bound so we may use random classifer for that benchmark

* Random Classifier :
  ----------
   -> It helps to decide the benchmark for unbounded metrics

   We can use & simulate Random Classifier if required to get some standards to compare our
   trained model

   => Helps us to identify the Sensible Model


=> Log Loss just provide single numbers
   So we use confusion matrix in conjunction to get better idea

* 3 Confusion Matrix :
  -------
   1) Normal Confusion Matrix
   2) Precision Matrix
   3) Recall Matrix
