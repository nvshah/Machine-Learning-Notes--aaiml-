Tips

-> While doing with Jupyter NB :-
    Store your information from intermediate data into temporary/intermediate files
    to avoid pre-computation of such

=> You can store your computation in ML process to file, intermediatry
    \
     pickling computed information :- dump & load

     .p files are used // pascal source code files can be used to store computed results

=> Mean F1-Score (Micro Avg F1-Score) for multi-Label classification problem

=> sqlite is most used database 

(Feature Engineering hack) :
----------------
=> Provide more weight to some feature by repeating n times the value of that feature

=> Inorder to approximate the worst model for your problem just try to find out the random Model


* For comparing models (Probabilities base system)
  ------
   - compare the diff matrix (ie Confusion, Precision, Recall)
   - compare the Tr-Err, cv-err, Test-Err

   - compare the misclassification
