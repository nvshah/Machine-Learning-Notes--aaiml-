1. intro Problem

-------

i) Malware = malicious + software 

task :- given a file, check if it belongs to 9 classes of malware

* Business Obj :
  ------

   Type : 

   1) Multi-class classification type
   2) Multi-class probability estimates

   Probability estimates :- help us to determinne how confidennt are we with our ownn estimates !!
   							help us quantify the mathematical understanding of the results what we have

   3) Should not take few hours (not eexactly low-latency requirement)
       but it should finish in few seconnds or minute (it may not finish in milliseconds)


   => Very high data


 * ML - mapping :
   --------

   Metric :- 

     1) multi-class log loss
        ----
         REMEMBER :- small deviation from ideal value, log loss will penalize you for such things

   Constraints :-

     - Class probabilities needed
     - Some latency constraints
