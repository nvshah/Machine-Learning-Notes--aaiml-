2. EDA

- to get the byte size of byte files use :- os.stat()

----------------

1) Value Counts for class labels distribution
=> Classes in Data is imbalanced

2) Byte files size & class label relation explore

   Bytes files - preprocessing - BOW (vector of size 257)
   
   - using Box-Plots (ie observing Overlapping )

   - Unigram BOW for byte content interpretation of byte files
              \
               for all of HExaDecimal Words
   
   We can't use CountVectorizer because it requires all the files to be loaded inside RAM
   & 50GB of RAM is not affordable to everyone
   \
    So we made custom calculations to find the bytes files features & their counts
   
   [Normalize]
   => We also do Normalize the vounts of BOW of all hexadecimal words

   -> Thus each byte file will be represented by 256 dimension vector
        \
         - file : [size, BOW]

   
* Multivariate analysis on Byte files :
  ------

   - TSNE to reduce the dimension [257 -> 2 or 3]
   - Observe the TSNE plots
   - build the models & check more ascertainties


* Train-Test-Split :
  --------
   64% - 16% - 20%
   
   - S.T. Distribution gets uniformed among splitted parts (ie random|uniform split) 
     (not temporal split)
