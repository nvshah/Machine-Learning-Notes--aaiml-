* Featurization
  -----------

_________________

=> For a graph based ML, Featurization is very imp task 

* Graph based Featurization :
  ----

== SEt BASED ==

1) Jaccard Distance :
   ----
    -> If 2 people share lots of common followers then there is high chance that both of them
       share same Interests ie (may follow each other)

    => Jaccard Distance = intersection of followers / union of followers

    => The higher the jaccard distance the more chances of edge lying between given 2 nodes

    -> Jaccard distance is also used in sets, to find how much similar 2 sets may bes

    - we can compute jaccard distance between :-
          1) followers set of 2 vertices/nodes
          20 followees set of 2 vertices/nodes

    Interpre :- If any 2 persons have large overlapping for either followers or followee, then there 
                is high chance for lying edge between these 2 users (ie nodes/vertices)


2) Cosine Distance (Otsuka-OChiai coefficient) 
   -----
    = X intersect Y / Sqrt(|X| * |Y|)

    For larger Overlapping => Cosine Distance is larger


=> Jaccard distance & Otsuka Ochiai Coef, both of them are based on Set Logics

------

== RANKING MEASURES ==

3) Page Rank : (For Directed Graph)
   -----
    - One of the best way of Featurizationn for Directed graphs

    => You can think whole Web as a Directed Graph

    - If a certain page gets link direction from many other pages then its important website page

    - if a page is imp & its also getting redirection link from several other imp pages then 
      the given page is more important

    => Criteria :- numbers of link
                   quality of a link
                      \
                       -> To determine how good a Website is !

    core IDea ;- Imp Websites recieves (incoming) more links from other Websites in entire WEB

    All in all : (gist)
     ---
      - Given a directed graph : 
          for each vertex it gives score, representing how imp the particular vertex is in the graph

      => Page Rank can tell us relative importance/score of each pages in the graph

   Page Rank & Followers/Friends Relation
    ---
     Eg Let Say bill gates & Me  & some other random normal person

         bill gets is followed by many imp persons such as Mark zuckerbug, Pichhai, Nandela, etc..
         So chances that bill gates followed by some other person Pj is more than 
         chances that Pj follows me !!
         because Bill-Gates is in general Imp person


4) Shortest Distance :
  --------------

    1) Strongly Connnected Component :-
       - go from any vertices to any othe vertex in subset(ie Component)

    2) wealky Connected Component ;-
       - Ignore direction in Directed Graph & then check if every vertex can go to any vertex

       - to trace Community <--**

       - Users with similar interests, or
         people from same college or 
         people from same ethnicity or
         people from same regions 
            \
             could probably form 1 community

       => Weakly Connected Component can be thought of as Community sharing something same in region
       
       - If 2 users ui & uj belong to same weakly connected component then there is highly chance that
         they share some interests & thus edge between them high probability

       => Weakly Connected Component can help us detect Community from Graphs

    => Thus Shortest Path & Weakly Connected Component helps to spot out the Community of Users

    => detecting Communities & if given 2 users both belong to same communit or not


---------------------

5) Adamic / Adar Index :
   ------------
    - For Directed Graph (ie successor concepts)
    - to predict link in Social Network

    - For given 2 users x & y

        1) let u1 be user belong to common neighbours of x & y, 
            & u1 itself have large neighbourhood
           = this imply that u1 might be a celebrity kinda personality as it has massive neighbourhood
           -> So chances that x & y may relate to each other are less
         		(as may be celebrity has fan from diff countries, which not imply that those fans should know or follow each other)

       	2) let u2 be user belong to common neighbours of x & y, 
       	   & u2 have small neighbourhood
       	   = this can imply that x & y may have good chances to relate with each othe as 
       	     u2 has small grp means it can be friend circle of college friends or school friends

    => Thus if Adar inndex is large => less chances that given 2 nodes follow each other
                              small => good chances that given 2 noides follow each other

    In a nutshell :

       - If x & y have a neighbour that has very large neighbourhood, then chances of x following y  is less
         but if x & y have a neighbour that has very small neighbourhood, then chances of x following y are fairly good

       (MIMP**)
       => common elements with a large neighbourhoods are lesser significant when predicting connection between 2 nodes


6) Does person follows Back ???
   ----------
    -> If there is edge from a -> b then 
       find if there is edge from b -> a ???

       why ?? -> because there is very high chance that b follows back to a
               \
                how ?
                 -> most the time a normal person follows a close friends a  lot
                    & 
                    also he/she follows some of celebrity (but celebrity are rare)
                     & in such case There is only 1 directional following ie from Fan -> Celebrity

                    but in normal case :- 
                      when 2 school friends follow then there is bidirectional Follow Flow

7) Kartz centrality :
   ---------
    - Measure Influence



8) HITS algorithm :
   ---------

    Hub :- 
    ---
     -> Outlinks - links going away
     -  Lots of Outlinks
     -> If outlinks or outdegree is large then the page/node is called as Hub

     Generally People starts their internet activity/journey from the Hub & then propogate to the
     different websites 

     Eg of Hub :- Google (current age), Yahoo (in early days), etc...

       (kinda person who follows to many other)

    Authority :-
    ---
     -> lot of inlinks

        (kinda Celebrity profile who has many followers)
    
    Iterative Mode :-
	    1. Authority score 
	    2. Hub Score
	    
	    (After you update authority & hub score then you)
	    3. Normalize

	=> eventually authority & Hub Score will Converge after performing iterations


9) SVD : (singular Value Decomposition)
   ----
    matrix factorization can also be used Feature Engineering

    Adjacency Matrix : for each node/vertex i

    via Singular Value Decomposition - we can get 2 k-sized vector for any graph vertex i
    where k is the # components used for SVD

    So for pair of users ie u1, u2 => we can have 4*k features all in all
     for each user u1 => 2 * k |-> k from left singular & k from right singular = 2 * k
     so for 2 users  = 2 * 2 * k = 4 * k features 

____________________________

10) Weight Features

** Edge weight ;
   -------- 
    is calculated in such way that edge weight decreases as neighbour count goes up !!

     in-link weights
     out-link weights
     ...

     You have 6 such edge weight features for single ui


-------------
------------

=> all the 10 diff kinda features are computed & Load in Disk (ie via Pickling or other way)
   So next time we can do direct modeling on it
