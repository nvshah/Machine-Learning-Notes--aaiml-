* prepare & split
 -------

  -> Actually data is changing or evolving over time i.e following edge are changing
      \
       Temporal Nature

  * Temporal Nature :
    ---------
     => Data is changing/evolving over time
     -> We need to build out train & test data taking into consideration of temporal changing/evovling
        nature of data

     => Temporal split

     => But we are given only given snapshot at 1 particular timestamp
         \
          so we are left with Random Split instead if Time based split
          (In Real World ideal thing is time based split)

     Random split : 80-20


* Cold Start Problem :
  --------
   - There are some data (vertices ) in Test data for which I've no information regards in Train data
     at all
