Task :- (Link Prediction Problem)
--------------------------
   Predict Missing Links between users in Social Media Network
   ie 
     Friends Recommenndation in FB kinda Task

   => Need to find the Edge or valid link between users/nodes
   

* Data Info :
  _______
   -> Only graph relatin between different Users is provided (not other meta info is provided)
      ie
        Source Node -> Target Node

   => Pure Graph Based Link Prediction Problem <----***
      ________________________________________

   => Graph details provided is only a snapshot of any time t
      \
       But in real world this graph is dynamic in nature (ie changing & evolving)


* Mapping to Supervised Problem :
  -------------
   -> presence of directed edge from source -> destination = 1
      absence of directed edge from source -> destination = 0

      Thus binary classif Task


 * Following Back Feature :
   ---- 
    If u1 follows u2, then there is high chance (ie high probability) that u2 follows back u1


 * Featurize :
   ----
    - Eg #common vertices followed by both u1 & u2
    - other Graph based Features

---(MIMP)---
Key Task is to Come up with Graph based Features
 \
  then it will be standard binary classification Tasks 

______________

1) No Latency requirment :
   ----
    - no hurry in prediction 
      (can be every night or morning in the day)

2) Probabilities Predicting Usefulness :
   ----
    -> can help to display or show or recommend top k users for given Ui

3) Precision & Recall :
   ----
    If user is following ui -> uj, then I must recommend it ie Recall
    If user must follow ui -> uk then I should recommend ie Precision

    High Precision & High Recall => F1-Score can be useful

   1) F1-Score - for high prec & Recall

   2) Precision @ Top_K
      --------------
    -> If I recommend 10 (ie K) peoples, then how many of them are correct (ie how many of them will Ui will eventually end up following)
