Tips

* Classifier Chanins :
  ------------
   -  If 1 label is related to another label or 
      1 label has power to predict another label
      then such chains of classifiers is very useful

=> slmultilearn only uses dense matrix & not sparse matrix

=> When you have high dimension data, linear Models performs very well
