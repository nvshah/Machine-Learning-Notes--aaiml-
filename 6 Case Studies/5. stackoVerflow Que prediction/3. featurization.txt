REMMEMBER :
  
  skmultilearn will always use the dense represntationn of matrix
  so for high dimen TFIDF storage its not suitable

=> When you have high dimension data, linear Models performs very well

____________________

* featurization
  -----------
   - TFIDF featurization


* one vs rest :
  --------
   We need to build many models (ie 5500, as much as there are individual tags)


* Logistic Regression :
  ------------
   - For high dimension data its a cheap approach (cheap in the sense required less efforts)
   - Its similar to linear SVM in a result


( Hack ):
 -------
  Instead of using 1M points - use 0.5M points

                   5500 tags - use 500 tags

                   Also employing Weighted model : more weight to Title than Body
                   (as title have more sense of how que will be driven forward)

  - Also instead of using SGDClassifier(), we use logisticRegression() this time in hack

=> Add more weight to Title by repeating the title 3 times (ie for TFIDF it will incr count in vector)


------------------

* why Linear Models (logistic Reg) :
  ---------------
   - We have Text data -> TFIDF -> high dimensions

   => When you have high dimension data, linear Models performs very well

   1) We have very High dimen data !

      - so Logistic Reg or Linear-SVM is possiblee choice

   2) also we need to train many models because of one vs rest approach !!

      - So we took Logistic Reg (as its Time Complexity efficient)
