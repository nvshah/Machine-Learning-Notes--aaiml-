4. Data Preparation

NOTE :- Data givn :- each point corresp to pickup info 
         \
          We can find sub-regions from this pickup points 
             \
              ie pickup points clustered together & likewise according to pickup counts & frequency

=> We need to prepare data in such way that 
    we can get segmentation of regions in New-York City & time-intervals also get split up into
    interval of 10 mins

* Breaking into Regions :
  ------------------
   Q1) what is optimal number of cluster to break into ??

   K-Means : for clustering
    \
     Those areas which have more pickups will get densely connected

     cluster corresponding to pickups frequency/counts


* Inter-Cluster distance : (Constraints)
  ----------
  1) Regions must not be too large

     We want to find the surrounding cluster s.t. inter-cluster distance is less than 2 miles

      Why 2 miles -> because earlier we saw that average speed is 2 miles / 10 min
         			  so we can reach nearby cluster in 10 mins inorder to attend pickup !!


  2) regions must not be breaked into too small

     inter-cluster regions must be atleast more than 0.5 miles

  Thus we dont want the regions to be break up into too large or too small


* K-means clustering :
  --------
   Find cluster (sub-regions) s.t. 
      inter-cluster distance atleast is 0.5 miles  (min region size)
      inter-cluster distance atmost is 2 miles     (max region size)


   via Hyper-Tuning we found K=40 as nearest to our aim attaining 


* Time Binning :
  -----------
   -> unixtimestamp (UTC format)

   -> for given pickup times - find in which 10 min interval bin does it fall !


thus we have 2 information 
     \
      1) cluster id
      2) 10 min bins block number


___________________________________________


* Smoothing :
  --------
   Why ? -> sometimes bins possess 0-pickups
       \
        -> In a cluster there may exists 10 min time-bin s.t. in that bin there are no pickups

   ie 10 min bins possess 0 pickups

   So via smoothing we will try to re-distribute the pickups among the surrounding bins

   0 -> pickups in 10 min bins creates a problem of `ratio-features` :- zero division error

   => Smoothing is done only on Jan, Feb & March Data of 2015


------------

* Time Series Bin vs pickups :
  ----
   - each unit on x-axis corresponds to 10 min interval

   -> Featurization :- Fourier transform

	   FFT :-

	   * DC component :-
	     ------
	      - when sin-wave or any other time-series pattern Wave, is not centered around 0
	        then it will have DC-component

	        DC-component referes to peak at frequency = 0


  => So we cann use Fourier Transform (FFT) to get the features from the data
