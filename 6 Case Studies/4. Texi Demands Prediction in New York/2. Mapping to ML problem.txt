2. Mapping to ML problem

NOTE :- Data 
          - possess millions of entry
          - each entry corresponds to pickup information

* Mapping to ML Problem :
  ---------

   dask.dataframe :-
   ______
    - useful when we have datasets larger in size than RAM
       \
        filesize > ram_size

    - read blocks from a file at a time into memory instead of entire file

    - aggregation on column in dask will work in hierarchical manner


* time series Prediction :
  -----------
   So if we aim to plot #pickups vs Time plot, 
    & then we can get idea abt to predict pickup at time t via approximating at time t+1

  => Time series Prediction is special case of Regression

-> we have time series based prediction in current case 

* Regression ( Timer Series Base Data)
  ------ 

* Performance metric (kpi) :
  ------------
   1. MAPE
   2. MSE

   1. MAPE : (Mean absolute percentage error)
     ----- 
      -> as we are interseted in percentage difference so we are considering this metric
      -> because in business constraint what matter is percentage error more

   => We are using percentage as a way to quantify how far away are we from pickup estimation
