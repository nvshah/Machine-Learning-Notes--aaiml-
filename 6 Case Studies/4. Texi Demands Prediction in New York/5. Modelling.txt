 2 types of Features :

   1) Ratios Features & 
   2) Prev-Values Features

for a Given cluster ;- (ie Fix a cluster)

 1) Ratio Features  (Between 2 different Years)
    ________

    Let say data from 2015 - train
                      2016 - Test/CV

    For any given cluster/region :-
          If we can find the ratio relation between pickups at any given time t between 2015 & 2016
          then we can estimate the pickups for future events 

          ratio 
            r_t = Pickup_2015_at_time_t / pickup_2016_at_time_t

            Once you know r_t, you can get idea of p_t_2016 (given p_t_2015)	

    Intution:
      At the same instance of time t ie (10 min bin) What was the Pickup exact 1 year ago

      so we can use data from 2015 as a training data to give ans for data from 2016


 2) Previous values : (From same Years)
   __________

    For given cluster/region ;

       We can use Time-Series pattern to predict pickups at future time t 
       thus using same years data

       ie F(t) = F(t-1, t-2, t-3,...)  // t is time unit (10 min bin)


 => Thus we can leverage these 2 features ways to build the baseline model

 * Simple Moving Averages :
   ----------------
   => n is hyper-parameter  (S.T MAPR is lowest)

   1) Ratios : (SMA on rations)
      _____
      - at time t, we are considering all prev n values to estimate r_t

    	So r_t = avg of (r_t-1, r_t-2, ..., r_t-n)

    	que :- what should n be ??

    	n -> as hyper-param  {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8} - values of n
    	\
     	using MAPR as metric (KPI)
     	     _________________
        - best n found = 3  // after trying multiple scans

   
   2) Prev-vals : (SMA on Prev-Vals)
      ______

      - same way we can find prev-val

         p_t = avg of (p_t-1, p_t-2, p_t-3,...)


* Weighted Moving Average :
  ------------------
   - Provide weights to the ratios or prev-vals
   - more weight to more recent one 

   so in denominator instead of n it would be sum of all weights = n*(n+1) / 2

   -> for both ratios & prev-vals


* Exponential Weighted Moving Average :
  -----------------
   How bad I do in predicting previous time :- I can use that information as well to predict the next time

   R_t = ( alpha*R_t-1_observed ) + (1-alpha * R_t-1-predicted)

   -> for both ratios & prev-vals

-____________________________________

* BaseLine Model :
  ------------
   -> Prev-val are much useful than ratio values

* Now compare other ways trained models with the BaseLine model
