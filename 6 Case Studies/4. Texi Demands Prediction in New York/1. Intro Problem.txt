-----------
=> Time series Prediction is special case of Regression


_____________


* Intro Problem
  ------------

  Aim :- demand texi requirement for given location in New York

  Provide info to Taxi Driver such as :- in next k mins, which near by region will have good number
                                         of pickups


* Objective & Constraints :
  ------
   given (region, time-interval) => predict #pickups

     We can get region info from location via gPS from mobile of Taxi Driver

   Constraints :
      1) Latency (few seconds)
         \
          - model should response within a few seconds

      2) Interpretability 
          \
           - not much important

      3) relative errors 
          \
           - percentage error & absolute error
             percentage error in prediction is more importance in this case 
             Percentage Error in Prediction in diff region is of more important to Driver

         => Overall goal should be to make percentage error very low as much as possible !!
