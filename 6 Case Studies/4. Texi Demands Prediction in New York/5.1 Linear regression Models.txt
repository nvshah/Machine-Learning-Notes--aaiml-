* Linear Regression Models :
  ---------------------

  -> Linear Regression is used to minimize the RMSE & Optimize the model

  TimeSeries model -> linear Regression Model

  Need to find at time t+1 based onn time t => temporal nature


* Train-Test Split :
  ------
   - Temporal nature of data
   - Instead of Randmly Splitting, We will split based on time (70% - 30%)

* Cluster Centroid & MRU :
  --------
   - For given cluster, centroid is taken as lat-long 

   - For given time t, & given cluster/region we use most 5 recent pickups to estimate the pickups
     in near time

=> We will check Diff kinda Linear Regression against the BaseLine Model !

0) Baseline model :
   ---------
    -> using moving Average (ie Exponenntial Weighted moving Average)

1) Simple Linear Regression
  -----------
   -> try to find the weights for 5 most recent prev-vals, 

2) RF - Regressor
   -------
    - Feature importance due to probability
    - Exp_Avg came out to be most imp feature

3) XGBoost Regressor
   ----

=> Random Search is extremely useful hyper-Parameter Tuning Technique when number of hyper-parameter are more


-------------------

Key Take Away :-
  
  => Simple Baseline Model ie (EWMA) gives approx near performance to XGBoost & RF like

  -> We can add more features to model i.e via Fourier Transform [f1, a1, f2, a2,...]

  => generally For Time-series kinda Problem, previous values i.e t-1, t-2, t-3 ... works very well 
     normally
