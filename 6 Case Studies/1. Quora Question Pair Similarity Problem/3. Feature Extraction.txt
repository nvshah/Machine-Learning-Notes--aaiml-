3. Feature Extraction

---------

modules useful :- 
  
  fuzzywuzzy

=> Some techniques & Features are specialized to some specific case/scenario/

---------

- In violin plot or box plot, the more overlap in the plots we have the worst is the conclusion
  or hard is to differenntiate classes from that Overlappinng Feature

__________

- Words_Common  // is imp in case of Quora Que Pair

* Words_share :
  ------
   -> Not best bot Worst
   -. Has some value help us differentiating 2 classes


* Text Preprocess :
  ------
   - Stemming
   - Expanding Contractions
       \
        Eg % -> percent   (repalce with)
           ain't -> is not
           won't -> will not
           000   -> K        

* Advance Feature Extraction :
  -----
  module :- fuzzywuzzy
         \
          -> Helps to find similarity between 2 sentences 
              0 - dissimilar
              100 - very similar

  Word = Token but not a Stop Word

  To come up with similarity between 2 sentences S1 & S2, 4 tehcniques :
	  1) fuzz_ratio
	  2) fuzz_partial_ratio
	  3) token_sort_ratio
	  4) token_set_ratio

   -> ans in 0 to 100
      | 0 :- dissimilar
      | 100 :- very similar

  * Edit Distance :
    -----
     add | delete | shift  (alphabets)

     You have 3 options add, delete, shift

     If number of edit options are few to bring sent s1 to sent S2, 
     Then similarity is high between 2 sentences resp.

   1) Fuzz_Ratio ;
     ---
      -> works based on less edit options goal to similarity concept

      -> Even its good idea there is a problem

       problem : [partials string stuff]

         Eg  `RC Banglore` & `Royal Challangers Banglore`

             Eventhough both are similar fuzz.ratio() will be less becuase of more edit options need to be performed

         Eg RCB & RCR

             Though both are diff team their fuz-ratio will be high because of less edit options 	

   2) Fuzz.Partial_Ratio :
     ----
      -> Is there partial string that matches for me
      -> ASA match is partial but perfect  | partially match the strings

       problem : [Out of Order]

        `RCB vs CSK` & `CSK vs RCB`


   4) Token Set ratio :
     ---
      -> It takes set (unique tokens) into consideration & not all the tokens

      problem :- If something is repeating then token_set_ratio will give val of 100
