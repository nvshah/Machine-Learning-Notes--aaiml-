4. Feature Analysis


* Plotting Word Clouds :
  -------------------
- Specific word that is found more common in Duplicate Senetences &
                that is found more commonly in Non-Duplicate Sentences

  - Some words occur more often in class 1 as compare to class 0 & also vice-versa

* Pair Plot :
  ----
   BiaVariate Analysis

* Dist Plot :
  ---
   UniVariate Analysis

* TSNE :
  ----
   Visualize High Dimen Data

   - tSNE takes a lot of time to run on large dataset

* TFIDF W2V :
  -------
   -> instead of avg W2V

* Glove :
  ----
   Global Vectors

   - alternative technique to Word2Vec ie
   - given word it returns vector s.t. semntic meaning of words get preserved

* Final Modified Data Point :
  ---------------------
   -> Simple Features already available from original dataset

    added & calculated new features

    1) 15 new features (via fuzzywuzzy)
    2) TFIDF W2V using GLOVE for Q1
    3) TFIDF W2V using GLOVE for Q2
