Case Study (Quora Que Similarity)
-----------------------------

-------

=> Cost of Missclassification is very imp metric in case of Quora Que Similarity

________________

Aim : If 2 que are duplicates of each other	
       \
        Slightly Diff worded (phrased) but ans can be shared between them



* Business Obj & Constraints :
  ------
   - Miss-Classification should be avoided as much as possible 
       because if 2 que are mis classified as similar then answer will be shared between both
       which is dangerous


   Probability :
   ------
    -> You want to find probability that Q1 is similar to Q2

    -> You must define such probability because it allows you to define some thresold
       If you do not have probability score but either 1 & 0 
         then it would not help in this case scenario
       We want probability so that we can set some thresold for similarity between 2 Que.

    => So for this case having probability as an output is very useful
       \
        Also it allow us to set thresold ( to determine if to merge ans for 2 que or not )

* No Strict Latency Connstraints :
  ------
   It can take few minutes or hour
    but having said that it should not take hours of hour & days


* Interpretability ;
  --------
  - Interpretability is partially important (ie ennd user will not care about what particular features play role behind merging ans for given 2 Que)


MIMP Thing :-
_________
   Cost of MissClassification is very much imp in this case
