2. Data Outlook

-----------
=> If we do not have timestamps in Dataset, we cannot do Temporal Splitting

=> If there is temporal change in your dataset, ie data change over temporal axis, then 
   you must consider temporal split for your data

___________

-> Binary Classification Task (1 | 0)

- spend good time on Featurizaation

* Performance Metric:
 -------
  KPI :- Key performance metric for case

  1) LogLoss :
  ---
  => Whenever you have probability as classificationn or output val, Log-Loss is one of the best func

  2) Binary Confusion Metric


* Temporal Nature :
  -------
   - Type of Que change over time so Model should also change over time

     Eg When any Political Election Period arrives Que related candidate may be asked lot 
        in that period for speculation (Eg Trump vs Biden)

   - But in this dataset we do not have timestamps so we cannot do Temporal Splitting

REMEMBER
=> If there is temporal change in your dataset, ie data change over temporal axis, then 
   you must consider temporal split for your data
