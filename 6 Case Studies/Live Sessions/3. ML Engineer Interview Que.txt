3. ML Engineer Interview Que
----------------------------

Q1) Scratch Code for Naive Bayes

-> Problem of Numerical Overflow ~ close to 0 when d is large
   - instead of storing prob, store log of probabilities

  Calibration :- Model on Log Probabilities
    |
     - Platt Scaling, Isotonic Regression

Q2) Batch SGD Pseudo Code

Q3) Blur GrayScale Image (Computer Vision Problem) :
   -> We need Kernel
   - Box-Blur Kernel
   - averaging the neighboring

   => Every blur will have avergaing factor

Q4) GroupBy in Spark - map, reduce

Q5) WAF to add 2 sparse tensors
