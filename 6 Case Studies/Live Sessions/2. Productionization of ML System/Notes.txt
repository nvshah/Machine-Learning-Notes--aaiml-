* Quora Question Pair Similarity
--------
  No realtime but Offline (every few hours)

  SOA (Service Oriented Archi)
  -> When we have complex systems to talk to each other :- Rest API's & MicroServices
  -> FAST API or Flask API

  -> Pickle Files // Save the Models (learned things)
  - Pipeline for Preprocessing
  - AWS-Serverless   // Ec2 or Heroku (not to maintain hardware & all that)

  - Batch Processing

  - Dockerization & Containarization & Kubernetes  // useful when we have high throughput
    PAAS & Heroku & Dynos
     \
      -> Docker & Containerization & Orchestration is taken care by PAAS (like Heroku)
         So we dont need to worry

  - Spark & Distributed System  // trivially parallelizable

  [*]
  - Recovery Mechanisms
    (What if something goes wrong in production)
    Revert back to prev system
