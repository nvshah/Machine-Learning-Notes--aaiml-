---------

* BlackBox Testing
  WhiteBox Testing

----------

=> With SGD, we can do Incremental Training

=> LDA := MF + Diff Loss (than Squared Loss)

---------------------

Challange
 - large amt of training data
 - low-latency model
 - minimum log-loss

Q) How would you parallelize the GBDT ?
   -> GBDT can trained on Modern Large Spark Clusters

=> GBDT is low-latency
   GBDT can train large amount of data
   GBDT can achieve us minimum log-loss

=> We should prefer Log-Reg (Log-Loss) over Linear-SVM (Hinge Loss) !

* Kernel-SVM :
  ---
  - No control over latency, as we may not have control over #Support-Vectors

* Problem with Stacking :
  - Low-Latency cant be achieved
  - How to give Model interpretation

=> Most Company therefore first go with Logistic Regression & then Secondly go with GBDT


* Productionization & Monitoring :
-------------------------

* Monitoring :
  - check if model is working well
  - to check if hashtable is corrupted
  - to check if model is working in production

=> Incremental Training Model is very useful with Logistic Regression
   LogReg can do Incremental Training


* Cold Start Problem
  - New user or New Ad
  - only impacts historical rates
