Doubts Dimen Reduction ?


[Dimen Reduction & Pre-Processing]
1) Why to do Normalization/Standardization before PCA(Eigen Decomposition) 
   What if we do after applying the PCA (ie Eigen Decomposition)

   -> Just for sake of easing out math work

1) If we do Standardization earlier than PCA, then does Eigen Vectors obtained are also Standardized ??
   or we need one more Scaling on new Space obtained by Eigen-Vectors
