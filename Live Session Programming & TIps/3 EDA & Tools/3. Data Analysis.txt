3. Data Analysis

-----------

-> The only mandatory thing while defining plane is that normal should be orthogonal to Plane
   then that normal can be unit vector or any other going inn that direction
   for sake of simplicity we use unit normal vector

=> Standard Deviation & Covariance are also impacted by scaless

-----------


- Using Linear Algebra, EDA only

=> Key thing used in analysis can be :-
    {
      Mean, Median, Mode
      Percentile
      Distannce from Origin
    }

Q2) How to predict y for data point ??
    
    -> You can use Box-Plots/PDF (ie Median Speratinng out different features)

Q3) how to finnd good thresold ??
    
    -> 

Q4) If mean = 0 & Std-Dev = 1 then whether RV is Gaussian Distb or Its a gaussian RV ??

    -> no 

       Just because mean=0 & std_dev = 1 doesnt mean Gaaussian Distb

       So if variable is standard normal variate then mean=0 & stddev=1 but inverse implification is not true


Q5) Swiggy Delivery System, Give time of deliveries :- {d1, d2, d3,...}
	What info you could carve out ??

	- Avg :- Mean :- wont work  as some outliers (ie customers will not be satisfied)
	- Median    :- also wont work

	=> percentile :- gives you idea about how much % of customers satisfied
	      \
	       Eg 95 %ile - gies you idea about how much time it took to deliver to 95% of the customers

	=> We can use PDF & CDF to find the information


Q6) What is good metric to measure spread of a distribution that is lot skewed ??
   
    -> STd-Dev can be corrupted by extreme outliers because it uses mean

    Kurtosis measures how heavy the tail is

Q7) Eqn of HyperPlane with normal to plane W is ??

    If passing through origin :- W^T*X = 0   //Eqn of Plane

    // Eqn of Plane not passing through orign having y intercept b
       not passing through Origin :- W^T*X + b = 0 

Q8) Shortest Distance of Point to a Plane ??
  -> Dot Product to Normal / Norm of Normal

Q9) Shortest Distance of Point to a Hyper-Sphere ??
  -> ||p|| - radius

Q10) Distance of Origin from Plane ??
  -> intercept_b / ||W||

Q11) Distance between 2 parallel hyperplanes ??
  -> p1 :- W^T*x1 + b1 = 0
     p2 :- W^T*x2 + b2 = 0

         b2-b1 / ||w||


Q12) Given delivery times for different days for Uber & Swiggy, How would you determine which is better ??
 -> Plot PDF & CDF

    By percentile
      but Just if 99th percentile are same doesnt mean that 50th percentile are same

 -> QQ plot (comparing 2 Distributions)

 The avg time of Swiggy & Uber may be similar but 90th percentile of both may not be similar
 
 -> KS Test

Q13) Given QQ Plot find the Distribution of Random Variable X :
  
Q14) Given Unfair Coin Create a Fair Event Output from that coin
