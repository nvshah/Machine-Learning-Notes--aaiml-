Doubts

1) Distance of Origin from plane How ?? b / ||w||

2) Confidence Intervals vs Significance Levels ??

3) Why to do Normalization/Standardization before PCA(Eigen Decomposition) 
   What if we do after applying the PCA (ie Eigen Decomposition)


4) High Dimension & Linear Seperation 

   During Video of Interview Que for SVM ?

   -> I caught up with this que :- 
        In high dimension data is easily Linearly Seperable, Comparatively

     I understood the statement (theoretically)

        [My Understanding] :-
        - ie As dimension increases We have more information & thus we can derive better seperation line

     But still I cannot absorb it at 100%

     So can you explain it in more intutive way to understand & imbibe it conceptually
