3.1 Gist LowLatency
---
REMEMBER

Real Time & Low latency :-
 -> For training of Model, Real-Time doesn't mean milliseconds,
    It may go upto minutes (ie let say 10 mins as well)

----

- Batch vs Real-Time Prediction

- Static vs Dynamic Features

- Model Compression
- Knowledge Distillation


---------

For Productionization : (2 ways)
 ----------
  - 1. Fast Inference
         \
          C|C++
          model Compression | Quantization

    2. Low-Latency Pipeline
    	 \
    	  Offline (Spark)
    	  Online (Kafka)


* Low-Latency Model-Change :- Continuous Learning
  --------
   -> Continuous Learning
        \
         Online Learning

- Stateless vs Stateful Training
- Misclassified & Just Classified Points

- Model Updation | Incremental Learning | Model Transfer Learning
