4.2 Intervie Que on Productionization 2
-------------------------------

-----
REMEMBER :

 => Random model maybe Worst Model in terms of Performance, but it gurantees to be Non-Biased

 => Every Model will have the MetaData File (ie most probably json file)
       \
        that stores the info such as Weight, Featires,...

 => Compute Cost vs Performance Tradeoff becomes very Severe for Deep Leanring
     |
     Most Imp TradeOff for DL is Compute vs Performance

* ML 
---

(1) Test Model-Bais :
----------
   - Here bias is Social Bias (not that variance relate ie overfittinng underfitting bias)
           \
            ie Racially Bias (created disadvantage to minority)
               Gender

   - Eg Gender Bias :
     ---
      1. Dont Consider Gender in Features // (ie may be during Training)
      2. Compute Feature Imp for Gender & make Decision Likewise
      3. Hypothesis Testing
      4. Watching Distb of predicted val based on category


REMEMBER :
---
 => Random model maybe Worst Model in terms of Performance, but it gurantees to be Non-Biased


* Bias & Distribution :
  ----
   - If distb of Male, Female or None is more or less almost overlapping then 
     we can't say it is not biased but the probability of it being biased reduces (as overlapping increases)

   - You cann use KS-test to check similarity between 2 Distb


(2) Incorporate Features from Diffd Team :
---------------
 - Egineering problems | (ie Productionzation kinda Tasks) (Lead Roles)

 1. Data Versioning (GIT)
     \
      -> Versions, TimeStamp, & MetaData for Model


(3) A|B Testing Infrastructure :
--------------
 -> Random Number Generator


(4) Retrain Scheduling :
--------------
 - System Design (Diagram) | Phases
    |
     - Train Pipeline, Validation Piepline, Test Pipeline
       Deployment Pipeline,
       Retrain pipeline (ie Updates)

       experimentations

 -> Here basically we need to think from the perspective of LifeCycle


______________

* DL 

(1) CNN | DL :
-------
 - what are challanges to deploy the DL models like CNN

 TradeOffs Matters :-
 --------------
  1. Compute Cost vs Performance 
         \
          becomes very severe for DL

  2. Adversarial Attacks
       - Model with low robustness

 [**]
  => Most Imp TradeOff for DL is Compute vs Performance

* Adverserial Attacks :
  ---
   - If you have an adversary (ie Opponents), that knows which models is being used
     So
     Some Noise can be genenrated So that it will trouble the System (ie Model) in prediction

* FPS & Server TradeOff :
  -----
  Q) What if we dont have enough server resources avail at hand (thus, We can't leverage the Load 
     Balancing Effect to its Extent)
    
    -> 1. Use Client Side Computation Way :
           \
            dont rely on server for all computation

       2. Model Pruning & Model quantization 

       4. Rescale Down the Image (in case of CNN)


* Model Quantization :
  ----
   - Uses fewer bits to store each weights (ie 8 bits instead of 64 bits)

  Model Pruning :
  ----
   - remove all weights which are useless 
      \
       multiple strategies like L1-Regularization	


___________

* Recommended System

(3) Rec Sys for Music|Video
--------------
 - Recency & Frequency
     \
      lots of importance is given to recency & frequency

   Problem :- Training Model for recent & frequent data is very expensive & computational challange
              (as it involves MF things)

   que :- how to incorporate Recency & Frequeency factor for RS in a better way
     -> You can use simmple Item-Item Similarity


--------

Q) Simplest ML Approach for Auto Completion :
    
    -> Probabilitstic Model
