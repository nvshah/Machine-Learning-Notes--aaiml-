5. Imp Concepts

- Biggest Pro for using Lr-Reg is its Interpretability 

________________

* Error & Normal Ditstb :
  -----
   -> Lots of Noise | Err are represented wrt Gaussian because of some hints of CLT 


* Auto-Correlation & Error :
  ----
   -> auto-correlation comes when it comes Time-Series Data
           \
            there is some relation between them

   ARIMA :
   -----
      - Auto-Regression Model

      - If you have auto correlation between past data & present|future data then it is preferred to   
        model using ARIMA 

      - Designed to keep Auto-Correlation in mind


* Check Linearity :
  ------
   If via introducing Quadritic or Cubic Feature check if Loss is reduce ??
     - if loss is reduce then Linear Combination is not probably the best answer

TIP :
  -> Linear Reg is used often for Baseline model

* Feature are Correlated : (Multi-Correlated)
  ---------
   Then biggest impact on :-
     - Interpretation of Model
     - Stability of Model
         \
          If weights can vary too much (then its sign of instability)

   => Biggest Pro for using Lr-Reg is its Interpretability 

**
[Fundamental Problem in Whole ML] :-
=> If your Data changes Dynamically Then almost all ML will goes for toss

* Channging Data Over Time:
  -----
   -> You need to then focus on Features whose distribution gets least affected over time


* Linear Reg & Other Models : 
  ----
   - use Lr-Reg as baseline model
   - use Lr-Reg to debug the data
   - use Lr-Reg as nice interpretable model (to explain others (non experts) how model behaves )

* Dimensionality & Log vs LR Reg :
  -----

Que) when dimensionality is large then Euc-Dist will go for toss & Lr-Reg may not work well
      but 
     at same time Log-Reg works well comparatively  ??

     How ??
     -> 
  
  -> If you start thinking Lr-Reg or Log-Reg or any Linear Model from Probabilistic Standpoint then
     Dimensionality won't be much issue !

     but if you think from Euc-Dist StandPoint then (its geometrically) & all this is distance 
     then you may consider abt Dimensionality

  -> #hyper-planes we have is high for higher dimension

  -> As dimen incr, so concept like Euc-Dist becomes more & more weaker


* In Bio-Infomatics :
  -----
   -> SVM is highly used (because of Kernel)


* High Dimensional Data means :
  ------
   d >> n  // ie number of dimension is greater than data points available at hand
