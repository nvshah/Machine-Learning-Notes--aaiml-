2. Why & Insights Probability Approach
---------

Que) Why Epsilon is assumed to be Gaussian Distributed ??
 ---------
  -> because we know That for Probability (ie pDF) in Gaussian Distribution there is exponential part
     &
     log can cancel out exp part
     &
     Wherever there is probability Just try to think if log can be used somehow (as log is often used in case of derivation or in scenario of Probabilities based approaches)

  -> Thus this will make math work easy

  So as much epsilon is near to Gaussian Distb => Model will work very well (as we are close to our assumption)
  & 
  as much epsilon is far from Gaussian Distb => Model will degrade (as we move away from our assumption)
