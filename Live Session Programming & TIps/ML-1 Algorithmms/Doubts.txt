Doubts

1) High Dimension & Linear Seperation 

   During Video of Interview Que for SVM ?

   -> I caught up with this que :- 
        In high dimension data is easily Linearly Seperable, Comparatively

     I understood the statement (theoretically)

        [My Understanding] :-
        - ie As dimension increases We have more information & thus we can derive better seperation line

     But still I cannot absorb it at 100%

     So can you explain it in more intutive way to understand & imbibe it conceptually


2) 
 Doubt ? -> 
  How Stacking is much better way to do Weighted Random Forest Model, Where each Base Learner is Weighted ??
