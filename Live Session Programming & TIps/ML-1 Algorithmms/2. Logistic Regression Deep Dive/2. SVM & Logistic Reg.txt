2. SVM & Logistic Reg
 ---------------

* SVC :
  ---
   Linear Kernel = Hinge loss + Reg


* Support vectors & margins :
  ---------
   -> Margin Maximization is one kinda Regularization Strategy

=> Sigmoid does take care of Outliers to some extent
   Sigmoid does mititgate some problems of Outliers



* Outliers vs Rare Event :
  --------
   - depends on domain knowledge


* M Estimators ;
  ------
   - techniqye in optimization
   - tampered loss val beyond some val
