Decision Null Hypothesis

-> Here We assume H0 = no diff between PM & PW

   obs = actual diff
   
   Now Via Test we found that P(ts > obs | H0) = 3.6%
    => only 3.6% of population have diff >= obs diff
       whereas rest 96% have < obs diff

    as diff less doesn't implies that more similarity (ie no diff approximately)

   So in such case when 96% time diff is almost small than obs diff, ain't we should accept Null Hypothesis ??

   because Null Hypothesis also assume of no diff & we also get higher chances of less diff than observed diff 96 percent of time
