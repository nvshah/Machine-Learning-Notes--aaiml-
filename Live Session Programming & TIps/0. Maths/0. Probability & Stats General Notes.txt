0. Probability & Stats General Notes

* Confidence Intervals vs Significance Levels ??
  
  - 2 diff things in 2 diff contexts

=> Based on Quantification of meaning of Similarity You should decide your Test-Stats & Null Hypothesis

- Desig test stats with communicationn with Business Teams
 
* Null Hypothesis :
  --------
	=> Choose Null Hypothesis s.t You can simulate it (simulation such tests is easy)

	=> Choose Null Hypothesis s.t You can simulate it
	     \ 
	      -> Simulating Similarity is easy (via Randomization)
	      -> Simulating non-Similarity or diff in population is extreme difficult

	   Simulating there does not exists diff is easy :- so we assume no diff in case of Null Hypothesis in permutation testing
