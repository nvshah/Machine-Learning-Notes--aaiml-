* Probability & Stats 3
  ----------

* Causation & Correlation :
  --------
  => Correlation doesnt imply Causation

  - Scientific/Medical Experiments

  - Randomized controls Trials | A/B testing | Bucket-Testings

=> A/b test used in productionization of ml models

* Loss of Data (Transformation) :
  ----
   When can you say some data loss during transformation ??
     -> When you transform X -> X` & you can't go back to X from X`
        then we can say some data loss during first transformation


* Eg Consider Drug Company
  ------

  Placebo :- empty capsule

=> NOTE :- For a good experiment 
             - randomization is key part
             - sample size also matters
             - Null Hypothesis is also imp
             - P-val matters


* Randomization :
  ---

  Non-Randomized Experiment :
  --
   - Eg If some drugs given to patient from Hospital H1
        &
        Some other drugs to other patients from Hospital H2

        This is uncomtrolled & non-randomized Experiment


* Concurrent A/B Test :
  ------
   - mostly this kinda test done on E-Commerce Company

   - Eg Change Buy Button Color
        &
        Increase Title Text Size

   -> 2 Diff Random Number Generator are used to split people for A/B Test per each Experiment

      Here we have 2 experiment & both experimment are done simulataneously
                    \
                     Change Button Color
                     Increase Title Text Size

   => Note :- Both Experiment must be mostly independent (there mmay small amt of dependence)
