* Probability & Stats 2.txt

---------
TIPS

=> Choose Null Hypothesis s.t You can simulate it (simulation such tests is easy)
  
--------

- Computer change modern stats leaps & bounds

=> Time it takes between your phone calls ie at t1 & next at t2 is often represented by exponential distb

=> log Transform is generalization/special-case of BoxCox Transform

=> In some situation Linear Regressionn tends to work better when features are close to Normal
   than Non-normal

=> Every Distb has some parameters (ie paramteric Models)

=! At internet company you see lot of Pareto Distribution

=> Distb are lots of likes models

-------------------  

* Causation & Correlation :
  ----------------

* Parametric vs Non-Parametric Statistics :
  ----------
   Parametric Stats :
   	 - cares abt Distb/Models
	 - we are trying to fit to some Distb/Models
	 - so we have some assumptions

   Non-Parametric Stats :
     - don't care abt Distb/Models
	 - It's much interested in randomly & independent pickup of obsv in sample

	 - Randomly & Independent

	    (Eg Picking the person should be independent of prior pickups)

	 -> It says that let use computer for simulation to tell everything that 
	    parametric stats says !!

	 -> requires slightly larger amt of data than parametric stats (as we need to simulate via computers)
	    \
	     because its making no assumptions as well
             
------------

* QQ Plot :
  ------
   - Observed Quantiles
   - Theoritical quantiles

   In QQ plot as long as majority or vast number of points are on line, its good

   -> As sample size increases, fewer aberration will be spotted

   Rule of Thumb :- 30 or 100 min sample points

   mimp things to check :- all quantiles points are on straigh line or not (for Normal Distb)


* Exponential Distb :
  ----
   eg UseCase :-

      Time it takes between your phone calls ie at t1 & next at t2 is often represented by exponential distb

      Time between 2 Phone Calls  (Electronics & TeleCommunication engineer)

   => Exponential Distb is simplest Power Law
   

* BoxCox Transform :
  --------
=> log Transform is Special Case of BoxCox Transform 

--
NOTE :- You have to do mean-Centring + Variance-Scaling before diving into Model  
--

* Study of Distribution is knnown as Parametric Models :- Paramteric Study 


* Pareto Distb :
  ---------
   - Falls faster than Exponnential

   Eg Salaries of People follows Pareto Distb (Economics)
      Prices of Products Purchase


* QQ-Plot vs KS-Test :
  -------
   QQ-Plot :- Visual Based
   KS-Test :- Hypothetical (ie more numerical approach based)

=> Distb are lots of likes models

* BootStraping :
  ------
   - Its a non-parametric strategy for stats
   - no assumption
   - Computational Simulations

   - Random Sampling with replacement

   - n, m, k

     n = sample points
     m = each bootstrap sample size
     k = number of bootstraps

   - Assume Population is following Beta Distb & took 100 samples from it


* beta distribution :
  ------

--------------------------------

=> Pareto Distb can have Outliers

* Permutation Test + Resampling :
  --------
   - Completely Non-Parametric (does not assume any kinda distribution)
   - Given 2 Observed Distb, we need to find the similarity
       \
        It doenst care what kind of underlying distb both given distb belongs to

   - One of way to do Hypothesis Testing
   - We can use any Test Statistics of our Choice

   Null Hypo :- Women & Men spend same amnount

=> Choose Null Hypothesis s.t You can simulate it
     \ 
      -> Simulating Similarity is easy (via Randomization)
      -> Simulating non-Similarity or diff in population is extreme difficult

   Simulating there does not exists diff is easy :- so we assume no diff in case of Null Hypothesis in permutation testing 


* KS Test :
  ------
   - It's also one of the way to find similarity between 2 Distribution (Parametric Way)
   - Given 2 Distb It computes the CDF & see gap between them

   - Its a Parametric method because it uses Konglomorov Distb (underhood to find the P-val)

   - It uses gap to provide the P-values (via help of Konglomorov Distb)
              \
               Maximum Gap info is used by KonGlomorov Distb

   - Supremum of the gap :- test stats
   			\
   			 Maximum Gap between 2 Distb
         => This maximum gap follows a Konglomorov Distb

   => Thus Konglomorov Distb is used to give P-Value

   - null Hypothesis H0 = Supremum Gap between 2 Distb = 0


* Konglomonrov (K) Distribution :
  -------
   -> K distribution is used in KS test to study
