4. Interview Que on Probability & Stats
--------------


--------
TIPS

FACT :- Mostly in E-Commerce the distribution is Power-Law Distribution

-------
REMEMBER

- Emperical CDF := Observed CDF

-
For Discrete RV :- PMF  // Probability Mass Function
For Continuous RV :- PDF  // Probability Density Function

- PDF := is Derivative of CDF
- Derivative := Slope of Tangent at a Point

-------

Q1) CDF to PDF  | Differentiate
--------------------------------
 [CDF, PDF, Calculus, Coding]

 -> Emperical (Observed) CDF to Emperical PDF

 X is Continuous RV

 [NOTE]
 For Discrete RV :- PMF  // Probability Mass Function
 For Continuous RV :- PDF

  1. For Discrete RV : 
       - Its Trivial
       - We just need to take diff of curr to prev & catch out probability

  2. For Conti RV :
       - Thus we need to find PDF here  
       - Idea :- Differentiate

  Soln :
  --
   -> PDF := is Derivative of CDF
      Derivative := Slope of Tangent at the Point

   -> To get the best possible approximation for derivative of any given point xi
       - try out the leftmost & rightmost point of xi
         & see which one is closest to it

         Which ever point is closer (ie either left or right) we will pick that
         & calculate `rise over run`

   -> Simply Compute best approximation to slope at each given point as best as you can !

   NOTE :- We will not get perfect CDF
            but it will be best approximation 

Q2) PDF vs PMF :
----------
 -> For Discrete RV : 
       - Probability vals ie PMF's val must lie between 0 & 1

    For Valid PDF plot :
       - Area under the Curve should be = 1   // (As PDF = Derivative of CDF)


Q3) CLT :
--------
 - Given some mean, & Std-Dev for some Continuous RV
    |
    We can apply CLT to get normally distributed data


Q4) Interval Population | Unnknown Distb 
---------
 How many points lie in certain interval without providing any details of underlying distribution

 * ChebyShev's InEquality 
   ---
    - One of imp equality in prob theory is ChebyShev's InEquality


Q5) Probability Que on Bayes Theorem 
 -------
  -> Logic : Conditional Probability


[**IMP]
Q6) Experiment in Ecommerce (A|B test & P-val):
 ------------------------------
  - Actual (Emperical) Data
  - A|B test

  Find : P-val diff between red & blue button in sales
         or
         We need to annalyzze if there is actual diff in sales when red or blue button is used !

REMEMBER :- Mostly in E-Commerce the distribution is Power-Law Distribution
---

  -> Available Techniques :-  
        - KL-Test, KL-Divergence
          QQ-Plot

        - Permutation Testing (with Resaampling) (with median as Test Statistics)
---
REMEMBER :- KS test tends to fails for longer tails
---

  -> Try to play with multiple statistics (for Permutation Testing)
        \
         mean, median, diff-percentiles


Q7) Proportional Sampling (Variation)
  ------------
   -> Instead of element itself connsider square of elements while doing sampling 
      (for weightage| proportion)

      Remember 2 things whilst implementing : Keep track of elements in original arr
      ->
      In the final output arr, elements must be same as what belong to original input array (order may varies)
      beware of what proportional conndition is used underneath
       
      1) create new arr for respective proportional condition (ie Squared of each term)
      2) Apply Proportional Samplinng on new arr (but argindex based) 
           \
            so that we have track of element's index itself rather than element itself

      3) Based on sampled indexes just represent original vals in output array acordingly
