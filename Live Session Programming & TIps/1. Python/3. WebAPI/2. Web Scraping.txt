2. Web Scraping
-------------

lib :- { BeautifulSoup, grep, urllib2, selenium }

- Web Scraping :- Obtain your own data !
- What Google is doing :- Internet Scaled Web Scrapping

TIP :- If API is available to obtainn data then use it (legally) instead of Scrapping

* Static Web Page & WebScrapping :
  ------
   Static Page := Html 

   1) Obtain Web Page Content (via urllib)
   2) Decide what you want to grab from that Page 
   3) parse & get that data from page (via BeautifulSoup)

* Dynamic Web Page & WebScrapping :
  -----
   Dynamic Web Page := Static Html + JS

   The problem is that you will obtain the static page content via (urllib) but how you will
   get the dynamic effect that is resulted by JS

   selenium.webdriver :
   ----
   - To achieve/simulate this you need `selenium`  that help you run that html page with js via your browser

   - selenium let you open any browser of your choice

   - selenium helps to perform action on WebPage via Browser

   -> So we will replace urllib2 with selenium in case of dynamic web pages
