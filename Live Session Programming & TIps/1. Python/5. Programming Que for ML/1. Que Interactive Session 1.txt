1. Que Interactive Session
-----------------

Q1) Searching in Matrix
----
 -> BINARY SEARCH O(logn + logm)


Q2) Derivative of Function 
-----
 Concepts :- [Derivative ,  ]

 -> for given point q, we need to find derivative of F(x) at x=q   // upto 6 decimal places

    Given F(x) is conti & differentiable

    So we will find the slope around q 

    > How to choose delta around point {q}

 REMEMBER :- as delta decreases, the accuracy of derivative point increases

 So h = 1e-6 will not give ans in accuracy upto 6 decimal places always // h is delta 

 Soln :- (DIVIDE & CONQUER)
   Do Binary Search (Divide & Conquer) kinda Logic & decrease {h} till we get accurate ans within 6 decimal places

   Take some initial val of {h} & start decreasing h till it won't change for 6 decimal place
   Thus derivative becomes more accurate

   One approach is :- divide h by 10 in each iteration

   Idea (gist) :- Keep Loopinng till 6 decimal places get match

Q3) Derivative of Function Where input is Vector :
-----
 -> Vector Derivative

 Strategy :- ( Loop + Pertubation ) as above  !!

Q4) 2 Arrays
------
     A -> Non-Decreasing order
     B -> Non-Decreasing order

    Merge 2 array s.t. resultant array is also in sorted order

    Soln :- 2 Pointer Soln
