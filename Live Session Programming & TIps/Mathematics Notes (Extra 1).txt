Mathematics Notes (Extra 1)

-> Good Mathematics Function :
   -------
    -> sin(x)/x
       cos(x) - sin(x)

=> How to test such complex functions !!
   How to test optima, integral, derivative, ... functions you implemented manually ???
     -> For known function i.e( function output val known for input x) find & verify for such inputs.

-----------------------------------------------

-> Bisection Method vs Newton-Raphson :
   -----------------------
   	Bisection Method -> Divide & Conquer
   	Newton Raphson Method -> Derivative

    -> How quick you are converging towards your goal [Newton-Raphson is best]


-> Gradient Method (For Convergence)

-> Feynman's method

-> ROC (Reciever Operation and Center) & AUC (Area Under Curve)

-> Integration problem can be break into discrete problem

   Integration is nothing but finding AUC via very minute delta or via large numbers of intervals between 2 point

   dx -> very minute delta of x

   Integration is Continuous, Summation is Discrete

-> Feynman method of Integration 

=> You can find area of circle by trapezoid rule
   By which you can find PI 

* Monte Carlo Approach (Simulation) :
  --------------
    It can be used to find the value or approximate the value of PI
    => Monte Carlo Approach tests understanding of Random numbers

-> Approximation using Polygon (with higher K i.e 100 around) to find PI

* Area can be found via 2 ways seen so far :-
  ---
   1) AUC - trapezoid or rectangle method
   2) Monte Carlo Approach 
   3) Approximation using Polygon  (to find value of PI)
