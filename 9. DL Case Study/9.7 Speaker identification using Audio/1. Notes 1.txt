1. Notes 1
-----------



----------

* Problem Defin :
  ---
  -> Application alike Smart-Speaker

  Multi-Class Classification Problem :
   -> Different kind of person identification (ie Speaker Identification)

* Audio Data :
  --
   -> per user :- input :- 30 seconds of data // into chunks 6 seconds * 5 chunks

   - Amplitude & Time

* Transfer Learning ? (CNN or Image Based from Audio/Sequence things)

Q) Why Audio to Image ?

  -> Inorder to perform Transfer learning via CNN

   Why CNN & not RNN ?
   -> because we have few samples of data & with few samples we cannot do RNN with Transfer Learning
      but we can do CNN for Transfer Learning with pre-trained data

      Pre-Trained Models such as AlexNet, VGGNet
       \
        -> Transfer learning is possible

* Audio-Image
  ----
  - WaveForm Image
  - Fourier-Transform
  - Spectogram

  => Spectogram is build via Fourier Transform applied over tiny gap of timespan over audio-wave

  * Dual Channel -> Mono Channel
    |
    Mono to Spectogram

  * Trim or Cut the Audio into small chunks

=> If we have 30 seconds longer audio then we will cut or trim this audio via `sox command`

* Pre-Trained Model :
  ---
  -> You don't have spectogram like data in Pre-Trained Model consideration
     |
     1. ReUser Archi + Weights of Pre-Trained Model

     2. Reuse Archi but trained Weights with lot of Spectogram Images

  -> Pre-Trained on Spectogram Image Specifically via AlexNet or any Image Model

  => This is also a transfer learning but ReTraining on custom data


* CIFAR-10
------------
 - design for 10 class classif
 - Pre-trained on Spectogram for 57 Speaker (from Internet collected audios)
 - Thus borrow archi from CIFAR-10 & trained weights from 57 Speaker's Spectograms


* Few-Shot Learning :
----------

-> What we want ?
   - For every speaker (person) all of their audio data must be clustered together
     or
     well seperated for every speaker

 - Similar Pairs
   Dissimilar Pairs

* Siamese Twins (Network)
----------
-> Similar Pairs & Dissimilar Pairs
-> We get d-dimen repr of 2 images pass through same CNN

-> Siamese Network to get d-dimensional representation

-> One of the plus of Siamese Network is that You can incrementally update it
   as we get more number of users


* Audio Length & #Users/Speakers :
---------

Few-Shot Learning :
    Eg - Face Detection (few faces per person)
