Concepts :-
--------
CNN,
Transfer learning
Fourier Transform  (for Audio to Image)
Keras

Few-Shot Learning
Siamese Network

_________

Tips :

=> Whenever you have audio data consider using Spectograms (instead of Fourier Transforms)

Key Take Aways :

-> Siamese Network with Few-Shots Learning
    \
     - Similar & Dissimilar Pairs Formation to get d-dimens data

   -> Once you get d-dimens data you can train model to classify the things you need (ie Speakers/Persons)

--------

-> Audio -> cut into chunks -> get image ->
   train on existing Image Model (Pre-Training)  // via reusing Archi & training Weights
   -> So that we can get d-dimen for images

   Now we will train a model for my 6 speaker & 36 Img that can classify

* Transfer Learning & Few-Shot Learning are useful at many instances

  Few-Shot Learning :
    Eg - Face Detection (few faces per person)
