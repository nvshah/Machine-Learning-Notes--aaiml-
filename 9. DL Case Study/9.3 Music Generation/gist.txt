=> Music := as a Seq of Events

- In cas of Char-RNN, you often apply Batch SGD

* Char RNN Model Essence :
  ---
  As long as You take some music &
  if you can represent it as an Sequence of an events
  Where events are characters
  |
  then you can utilise the Char-RNN Model

* Music Gen (General)
 - Char RNN
 - All falls down to LSTM & TensorFlow
