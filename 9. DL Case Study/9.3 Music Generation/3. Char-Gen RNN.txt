3. Char-RNN
-----------

- Music as Seq of Characters
  We want our Model to learn Pattern in this Seq
  &
  after learning generate some Seq for us

* Char-RNN:
---
- special form of RNN

Properties
1. Char RNN is built out of characters &

2. It's many to many RNN Archi.
   where every inp has its respective output.

[BEHAVIOUR]
3. In char-RNN, for a given layer
   given some inp character, we want to predict the next possible character in sequence

-> next character I should find in the seq.
-> What is the next probable character based on the pattern in this data so far.

=> If Char RNN learn such patterns then we can generate music notes

Application

- Generating baby Names
