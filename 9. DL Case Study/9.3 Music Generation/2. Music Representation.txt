* ABC Notation :
----
- MetaData
  Music :- as a Seq of Characters
   |
    -> Seq Structure

- Thus abc notation is super simple structure
  so that it can be represent using RNN
  |
  where we can discover which character must come after which one & likewise

=> Music := as a Seq of events

* MIDI notation :
----
- has 2 parts :- Notes Chord & TimeStamp

* Why no Mp3 :
---
-> in mp3 : seq of musical sounds

[REMEM]
-> ABC is much more efficient notation than Mp3 or Midi format
