6. Char RNN Stateful RNN
-----------------
ref : Char-RNN with abc-notation: State ful RNN

* StateFul RNN :
------
- It has to do with Batch Mode of Operation

- The output of the Previous batch is provided as inp to first Unit in next batch

  NOTE :- if stateful is false then for next batch also we consider Zero vector as inp to first unit
          but
          as if stateful = true then out of prev batch is somehow connected & feeded as inp to next batch

  - So its also the reason we Constructed the Batches (Row-Wise Continutity)
    because of this Continuity in our Designed batches, We can utilise Stateful RNN very effectively

-> In stateful RNN the Weights learn in any Batch will be retained

=> So that it can learn much more long term Dependencies
