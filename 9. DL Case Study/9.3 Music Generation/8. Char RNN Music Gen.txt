8. Char RNN Music Gen
-----------------

file :- sample.py

--------

* What our Model is about ??

 - Takes a single character as inp
 - Output a 86 length Vector  (86 Probabilities corresp to 86 Characters I have)
   |
   So on Sampling we will have Idea which character have higher probability for choosing next character

 - So this Model/Archi is like a magical machine
   ie once given a Starting Inp Character It will Recurring Generate Possible nect characters so on...


* Seed := First Character you provide to your Model

----
Code :- 

sample()
 - loading model from weight file (ie checkpoint)
 - batch of 1 element & 1 character size

 - What this func does is :-
    for given single character it generates the 86 characters

Note :- Model Output that avail at 10th epoch must be of
        lower quality as compare to model output of 100th epoch
