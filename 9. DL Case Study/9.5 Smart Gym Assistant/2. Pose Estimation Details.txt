2. Pose Estimation Details
---------------

=> Blaze Pose is Pose Estmation Research work to run on smart-phone

BenchMark Dataset
- Cocodataset
- mpi dataset

-> OpenPose run & works on images (ie take img as inp & give key point & connection for same)

--------

* Blaze Pose (Research Paper 2)
------
- designed by google
-> optimize for video based (in addition to images)
-> optimized for fewer people
-> Can run on Mobile Phones

- Performance Metrics :
  ---
  pck h@0.5 :-
    percentage of correct key-points
    headbone @0.5  // 50% of headbone link   (inorder to identify correctness of prediction)

  pck @0.2
    at torso length

  Avergae Precision & Average Recall


* Encoder-Decoder Model :
  ----
  - Hour Glass Model
  - Skip Connection helps to train more deeper models

  - 3 images for each keypoint

  - Heat Map :- tells you where are the keypoint
    Offset Map : how much offset is there for keypoints

  Coordinate Regression Network:
  - Not ran every time

  Stop Gradient Connection :
   - No Backpropogate


* MediaPipe (for BlazePose)
-----
- library for BlazePose
