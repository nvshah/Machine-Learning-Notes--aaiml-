Dataset (Benchmark)
- coco dataset
- mpi dataset

-> Open Pose
-> Blaze Pose


* MediaPipe

=> angle is best way to identify different poses

=> Encoder & Decoder's Convolution network will not change because of Regression Network Learnings


* Pose Estimation -> Pose Match -> Pose Correction

Tip
=> Wherever Model is not confident enough, we need Human Intervention (ie Manual Labelling)
