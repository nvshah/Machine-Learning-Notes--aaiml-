- Stick Models

-> There are 2 main things :
   1. Key points (representing body parts)
   2. Edges representing the connection between key points (Affinity Vector Fields)

- Confidence Maps   // to get more info to model (whilst training)

1. Define & Understand the Problem

* Simplified/High Level Design

  - Pose Estimation (from Camera)
    ( Pose Estimation is standard problem of Computer Vision )


* Key Points & Pose Estimation :
  ---
  -> Pose is typically represented via Key Points & connection between those Key points
  - PCKH is metric for evaluating the pose estimation

  - FPS is also important thing whilst tracking
  - Selected Frames

Architecture (Open Pose)
---
 -> Inpt :- Color Image
 -> Feature Extractor (1st 10 Layer of VGG 19)
    - intializa via VGG19

 -> Multi Stage CNN
    - helps to detect poses of person of variable scales

 -> 1 Stage : 2 Branch (ie 2 CNN Model)


Branch 1:-
  - predict stack of images
  - try to predict the set of 2d Confidence Maps of Body Part

 -> S_t := Set of 2D confidence maps of body parts
     |
      -> For every part of Human body we will have Confidence Map
      -> Predicted Confidence Map & Ground Truth Confidence Map for each prediction of body parts

     Ground Truth :
       - Exactly in Picture at which pixel is the particular part (eg let say Elbow)
       - computed simply using 2D Gaussian

Branch 2:
 - try to predict the connection between diff body parts (ie Key points)
 - Affinity Fields :
   There will be affinity fields for each edge

 - Here ground truth is Edge|Connection
   So
   how to represent it (ie How to create Affinity Vector Field ?)


=> Thus all in all for stage 1
   - Branch1 is representing the body parts
   - Branch2 is representing the location of connection of these body parts

   1. Confidence map of parts
   2. Vector Fields of Part Affinities (edges)


* Graph Based Algorithm to Solve Overlapping Problems

  K-Partite Graph


=> number of stages is a Hyper-Parameter
