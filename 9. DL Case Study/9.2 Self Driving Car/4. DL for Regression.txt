DL for Regression
-----------------

---------
terms notes

- end to end models,
- CNN-RNN

----------

Problem :- Upfront it is a Regression Problem
 given Seq of inp imgs => Predict Seq of Steering Wheel Angles

* Case 1 (Not use Seq Info)
----
 - Given single img -> predict some output
   |
   for this ConvNet are very useful
   as they are very good at img processing

 - So here you can use simple ConvNet for Regression

* Case 2 (Consider Seq of Images as Inp)
-----
 - Kinda CNN-RNN archi

 - Inp := imgs + Seq   // Seq of imgs = Video
   Out := angles  (Seq of real numbers)

 - Many to Many RNN

 - each img from inp seq will go through custom DL-NN
   &
   thus we will have the output corresp to each inp img

 - each img in inp should go through this archi to have corresp out

=> Actual Real-World Self Driving car use very complex CNN-RNN

NOTE :- here we use only CNN for simple purpose (ie Case 1)

* End to End Model :
--------
 - takes care of everything
 - inp -> out

 - End to End model doesnt case abt dealing sub part seperatelt
   for eg :-
     detect road,
     detect lanes
     detect signals, etc...

    In end to end all this things are considered & final out is generated

 -> In our case End to End model for Case1 (ie ConvNet) would be
     \
      takes img as inp & provide angle as an output

 => Thus we are building end to end conv-nn model to predict steering angle given inp image from Seq

    CNN based regression model
