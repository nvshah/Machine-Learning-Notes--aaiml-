1. Intro Problem
--------

-> Used Generally
   - Cameras [Front, Rear, Side]
   - LIDR Sensors // to obtain 3D geometry around
   - GPS System
   - Ultrasonic Sensors
   - RADAR

Inputs

=> All of these sensors provide inps
   All of inps goes to Computer

- Sensory Inputs -> Computer

Output :-

=> Steering Wheel Angle, Break, Accleration/Speed
   Side-Indicators, Vipers, etc...

NOTE :- Auto Transmission System (ie No Manual Gears)

--------

* Simplified Minimal Version of Problem :
  ---
   - if someone give you front camera feed/video
     |
     predict Steering Angle

   -> Simplified Task would be
      - Given Seq of Images => predict Seq of Steering Angles Decision
