driving_dataset :-
  - images from front camera & steering angle

logs
  - all related to epoch

save
  - final model build will be saved here

NOTE :-
 Inp : seq of imgs
 Out : angle

* driving_dataset (folder)
  ---
   - sequence of image captured by front camera (dash camera)

  data.txt (file) :
   - for each image we have steering angle in degrees

   -> typical camera captures 30 or 40 images per second

   - 45K images with corresp steering angles (for 1 Video)


* Train-Test Split :
  ----
   Temporal Data (nature)
   -> This data has time (ie order/seq)
      There is sequence in the images

   -> So we should split based on time (axis)
      - 80% & 20%

   - The distribution of angles in first 80% may differ from those in next 20%

   - radians makes the range simple to work with


* Mean Baseline Model :
  -----
   -> use mean val as predictor
   -> or let say 0 as yi^
