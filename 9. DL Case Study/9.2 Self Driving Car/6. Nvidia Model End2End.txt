terms

truncated normal

----


-> Nvidiea use 75 hr driving data
   &
   We have 25 hr video data

- In this whole network, you dont have dropout, Max-Pool or even Batch Normalization

----
CODE

file :- model.py   // borrowed from sullychen


* truncated normal :- when we compress the range from tails side

* Dropout & Conv Layer & Fully Connected Layer :

  -> compare to 2 Conv layer, chances of dropout being present between 2 fully connected layers is more
     because
     there are more weights variable between 2 FC-layers, comparatively
     So need some sort of Regularization


- atan = tan^-1
   \
    arc tan applying at last (to get linear output)
