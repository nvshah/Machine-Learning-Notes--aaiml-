* Elastic search :
  - offers storage that supports inverted indices
  - Inverted Indices + Scoring Function
  - Allows to store sentence vectors

  - uses some form of Nearest Neighbor Search

* Keyword Search Result
   - TFIDF

* Semantic Similarity

* 2 approaches :- 1. Keyword similarity & 2. Semantic Similarity


-> title -> vector (USE) -> index via ES


=> Ealstic Search doesnt care which model you use to get Sentence/Query Vector
   as far as You get the Query Vectors

* Most of Copanies like Quora uses Something alike ES with Semantic Similarity
