2. Semantic Seimilarity
---------------------

-----------

- Nearest Neighbor Search


------------

-> Semantic Similarity instead of Keyword based approach (Elastic Search - Inverted Indexes + Scoring)
    |
     - Synonyms  (Software based)
     - Sentence Vec (ML/DL)

* Objective :- measure similarity between 2 que (via Sentence vectors)

* Sentence Vectors (NLP)
------
- Compute Similarity via Eucledian Distance mechanism

 1. Eucledian Distance
 2. Cosine Similarity

* Nearest Neighbor Search :
  ---
  -> Finding similar Question (ie Semantically)

=> Elastic Search supports storing setence vectors


* Containarization
------------------
- for solving Deployment ambiguity among diff teams

* Docker
  ---
  - LightWeight System (where we dont need to load whole guest OS)
  - Each Container runs some App

  -> VM are bulky whereas Docker is lightweight

  - Docker has different file system compare to your host local system
  - by default docker - containers bundles with your app & linux distributions (ie CentOS)

  - Helps to create Environment that is platform agnostic

=> Kubernetes helps to manage the Containers in Distributed fashion (ie Orchestrating)
