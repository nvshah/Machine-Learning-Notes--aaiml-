AIM : If we have data from Accelerometer & GyroScope from Mobile Device
      Can we predict the Human Activity such as
      Walking, Running, Sitting, Standing, Dancing, etc...

Usecase :-
 Smart Watches
 Eg :- Fitbit, AppleWatch, Boat

 using this we can
 helps to predict :- calories, heart rate prediction

 You can use this Activity to measures certain things such as calries burn, etc...

----

* Problem :
  --
  - GyreoScope
  - Acclerometer

  Angular Velocity measure over time along 3 axis
  X, y & Z axis over time

  Inp :- 6 Time Series Data
  Out :- one of the Activity (ie Running, Standing, Laying, Sitting, Upstairs, DownStairs ...)

  MultiClass Classif Problem

---

Notes :

-> Data is Time-Series based
   So Data is broken up in Equi-Sized Window (along time axis)

-> Window -> Filters (Signal Processing) -> Vector

* Overlapped Sampling :
  ---
   - I'll consider overlapping windows
   - Take next window such that it overlap somewhat with prev window

Data :- 6 time series data
--
 - from each (acceleo, gyro), we have data in 3 axis (ie directions)

 - These 6 time series data has bee processed & engineered into Features for us
   &
   the size of that vector of features is 128

 Flow :-
  -> Original Data is converted into Windows
  -> Each window we apply some signal processing filters & we get vector of length 128

  -> On top of these 128 features, there are also some other features engineered

=> Case study is tradeoff between Expert Engineer Features & Raw Time-Series



---------

1. Huma Expert Data :- we will apply classical ML
2. For Raw Data (time series) :- we will use RNN

=> RNN can work well with Sequential Data


Folder-Explained:
  - Inertial Signal :- Raw Time-Series Data

  - train.csv & test.csv are related to expert features
