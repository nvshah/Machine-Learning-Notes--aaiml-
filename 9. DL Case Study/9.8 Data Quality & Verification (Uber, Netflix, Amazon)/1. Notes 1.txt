Aim :
 - how to chck if data you have at your org is of good quality

1) Platform & Techniques (for High Data Quality) ??
->
  KPI, Utilization (CPU, RAM,...)
  Anamoly Detection

 * Anamolies in Time-Series Data | techniqyes ??
   - Time-Series Anomaly Detection

   - Detecting Anaomalies is all about Forceasting (Time Series) & if
     forcasted prediction is differ a lot then that is a alaram


* DQM (Uber)

  - Multi Dimensional Time Series
  - PCA & lower-dimen projection
  - Time Series Approach & Anamoly Detection  (via Forecasting)
     \
      - on lower dimensional data

    Eg 1000 dimen data -> take down to 10 dimen data
       &
       perform time series anomaly detection on 10 dimen data

  - PySpark & Hive


* Time Series Anomaly Detection :
  ---
  Holt-Winter Models
    - Exponential Moving Avg
    - Trends
    - Seasonality

  => Time Series Anamoly detection on top 5 Principal Components


* Why Exponential Moving Avg (Exponential Smoothing) ??
->
  - More weights to recent data


* Table-Level Scores :

-> There are 2 kind of Time Series
   Time-Series Metrics Anomalies
   Time-Series at Table-Level Anomalies

  Table-Level Score
  Metric-Level Score


* Table Lineage :
  ---
  - Some sort of combination of multiple tables (ie Join, combine, aggregate, etc...)
  -> When they see lots of tables has low score then it will generate Table Lineage like structure to track
     that down
