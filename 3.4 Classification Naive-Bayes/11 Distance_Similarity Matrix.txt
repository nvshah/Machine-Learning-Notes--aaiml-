11 Distance/Similarity Matrix

When Such Matrix ??
  - Writing a data point as feature is not trivial

-> Given similarity/distance matrix naive bayes is not capable of using them directly
   because naive bayes is Probability based approach & not distance based algorithm

-> So given distance/similarity matrix Naive Bayes is seldom used in real world
