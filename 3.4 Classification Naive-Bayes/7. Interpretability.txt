7. Interpretability

-> From prediction if we can say that particular words are associated more with class
   is nothing but interpretability of NB

-> for a given query pt Xq -> {w1, w2, w3, ..., wd}

     Xq -> Yq = 1  // prediction

     We can say this based on likelihoods of words that are more associated with class = 1
       \
        ie P(w5|y=1) or P(w7|y=1)   

           // such likelihood are high so we can say that w5 & w7 are highly associated with 
              class label=1
