* Outliers in NB :
  -------
  
  Outliers in Test data :
  
	-> Outliers are feature in test data which I've not seen in my training data

  Outliers in Training data :

    -> let say {w1, w2, ..., wm}

       then if w8 occurs very few time in both the classes ie
            if likelihood of w8 is less in both the classes
               then you can call w8 as an outlier in training data

    :) Hack(soln)

    -> define some thresold for word/feature to be get accounted
        \
         ie Eg if a wrod occur fewer than 10 times, then just ignore that word.
         	   ie drop that word from vocalbulary you have

         	   don't keep that word w in set {w1, w2, ... wm}
