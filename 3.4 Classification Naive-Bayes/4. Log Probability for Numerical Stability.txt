4 Log Probability for Numerical Stability


------------------

-> Log is called Monotonic Function
   Log doesn't change the order

   Log converts the multiplication into addition
                    exponentiation into multiplication

------------------

- Problem :
    As each term in P(Ci | D) is probability with value in range(0,1) so 
    as dimension increases that value becomes more shorted or unstable

    => Multiplying numbers between 0 & 1 is tedious & create lot of numerical stability issues
       like Numerical Underflow

    Why Unstable :
      As dimension incr -> the value tends towards more smaller i.e 0.000005
      So after floating point the lenght becomes more & more

      But Python have double precision of 16 decimal point & thus 
      It do have limit

      Eg 0.1 * 0.2 * 0.3  => more shorter number (ie numerical underflow)

    Numerical Underflow :
    --------------
     When digits after floating point exceeds 16 places, Python starts rounding

     Rounding may create errors

     so Instead of manipulating small numbers between 0 & 1, Manipulate the log of those numbers

- Workaround :
  ----
     Instead of using the probability directly, Use Log of probability
     -> Instead of operating on small vals, Its better to operate on Log Values

   => Log are much stables

  Log Properties & Subtelty :
  -----------------------
  => Log doesn't change the order i.e as x incr => Log incr
  => Log is called Monotonic Function 

  => Log Converts the multiplication into addition
                      exponentiation into multiplication

     exponential will convert log to back to normal values  

     e is revert back case for natural log ie ln
