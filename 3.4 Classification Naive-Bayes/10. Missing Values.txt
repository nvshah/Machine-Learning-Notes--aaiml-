* Missing Values

1) Text data :
   -----
    -> No channce of missing data as (There will be words in data)

2) Categorical Features :
   -----
    -> Whenever you have categorical features, You can consider missing val as one other category 
       ie (NAN) as another category

3) Numerical Features :
   ------
    -> Standard Feature Imputation methods


* Handling Numerical Features : 
  ---------------------------

  -> It's all abt the distribution we assume for the features

  * (Gaussian NB)
    ___________

    Let say i rows & j features 
      You want to find likelihood for M_i_j cell then

    - feature can take real values

    1)  
    -> Take data of particular class (+ve or -ve)

       Assume the data is Gaussian Distributed    <-- MIMP
        \
         -> Plot PDF
            & 
            then you can spot the probability i.e height in PDF

    => So main point is that we assume our likelihood comes from Gaussian Distribution

  * (Bernoulli NB)
    ___________
    - When the feature can take only 2 values 
    - So assume likelihood probability as Bernoulli NB


  * (MultiNomial NB)
    ____________
     
    - Occurence Counts ie Frequenncy Counts of Feature
