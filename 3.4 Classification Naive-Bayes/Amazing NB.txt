The simple answer: multiply result!! it's the same.

Naive Bayes based on applying Bayes’ theorem with the “naive” assumption of independence between every pair of features - meaning you calculate the Bayes probability dependent on a specific feature without holding the others - which means that the algorithm multiply each probability from one feature with the probability from the second feature (and we totally ignore the denominator - since it is just a normalizer).

so the right answer is:

calculate the probability from the categorical variables.
calculate the probability from the continuous variables.
multiply 1. and 2.
