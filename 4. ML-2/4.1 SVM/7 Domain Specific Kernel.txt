-> Feature Transformation is partially replaced by finding the right/appropriate Kernel

Domain Specific Kernel
--------

=> Since Feature transformation is domain specific more of so there are specialized kernel for 
   specific domain

   Feature Transformation = Kernel-Trick

- Text Classification Specialized String Kernel
  Genome based specialized kernel
  Graph Kernel Specialized Kernel

-> Effectively Feature Knowledge + Domain knowledge creates custom kernel (ie Domain Specific Kernel)
   for relevant problems

- Feature Transformation is partially replaced by finding the right/appropriate Kernel
