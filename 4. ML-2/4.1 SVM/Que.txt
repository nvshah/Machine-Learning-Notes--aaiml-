Q) Why going from Primal Form to Dual Form & Why in SVM ??
 -> 
    Because dual form have notation comprises of Dot-Product i.e We can have intution of Similarity
    & can take advantage of such concepts.
    ie Xi^T*Xq

    So enntire idea is to get it into Do-Product or Similarity based form


Q) How is SVM related to KNN ??
  
 -> RBF kernel Hyper-Param sigma & K in KNN are almost sharing same intution
    K - int
    sigma - can be float as well

Q) How is SVM related to Logistic Reg ?
 
 -> Log-Reg : Feature Engineering Explicitly
    SVM  : Feature Engineerig implicilty via Kernel-Trick
