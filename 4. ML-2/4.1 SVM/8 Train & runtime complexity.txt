- best library to solve SVM is `libsvm`

---------------


Train & runtime complexity
-------

* Sequential Minimal Optimization : (SMO)
  ---
  -> Optimization Algorithm to solve SVM


* Training Time Complexity :- O(n^2)
  -------

- Hence most do not use SVM when n is large 

Q) When n is large ???  
 -> Internet Applications (n is large & low-latency requirement)


* RuntTime Complexity :
  -------
   -> depends on #support-vectors
        \
         if SVs large, => run-time complexity large
                small, =>                     small

         Svs can be any from 1 <= k <= n

   => In Soft margin SVM there is no way to control number of Support Vectors

   So Complexity = O(k*d)

   In logistic Reg whereas the complexity was O(d) which is better than O(k*d), as in SVM depend on #Support-Vectors
