RBF Kernel

---------------

- 2 points which are dissimilar are farther away
  ie Kernel = Similarity
     Distance = Dissimilarity

- Hyper-Param in RBF based SVM :- sigma, C

-> sigma :- radius of influence

- RBF kernel is also called as Gaussian Kernel

Radial Basis Function (RBF)
---------------
-> It's similar to KNN in classification

RBF is most popular & General Purpose SVM kernel

=> K(X1, X2) = exp(-||X1-X2||^2/(2*sigma^2))   // similarity function
   
    sigma = hyper-param

- As distance incr, kernel val falls exponentially
    \
     As pts get farther & farther away, make kernel val = 0

  if Kernel val k = 0,
      \
       similarity = 0 => distance = inf

  Thus intutively Kernel = Similarity
                  Distance = Dissimilarity

-> RBF itself looks very much like a Gaussian/Normal PDF
   
   (Run Time Comparision) :- 

   In KNN, store all the K pts

      RBF :- only SVS -> alpha_i  (those alpha_i > 0 only)

   Often #SVS << n

   Biggest drawback of KNN was run time complexity 
   Where in RBF SVM we can overcome that as we need to calculate alpha_i for SVS (Support Vector) only

   -> Hence RBF-SVM is a nice approxiamtion to KNN
   -> Hence RBF kernel are used as general purpose Kernel


Hyper-Param :
  2 hyper-param in RBF Kernel :- 1) C for loss func
                                 2) sigma for RBF kernel func

  sigma is considered as radius of influence

* KNN & RBF Kernel relation :
  ----------------

  -> as sigma incr, same as K incr in KNN // ie accomodate more points in vicinity
              decr,           decr        // closest pt in vicinity


------------

* Landmarks :
  ------
   - choose some landmarks & calculate the similarity ie K() with those landmarks
