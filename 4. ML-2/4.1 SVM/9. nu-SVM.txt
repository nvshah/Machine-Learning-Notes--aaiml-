nu-SVM
------

C-SVM -> Original Formulation where C is hyper-param & C > 0

Alternative :- nu instead of C 

 hyper-param = nu
   \
    0 <= nu <= 1

    nu >= fraction of errors               // nu is upper bound on frac of errors
    nu <= fraction of support vectors      // lower bound on support vectors

 -> nu is maximum fraction of error that can happen

 Eg nu = 0.01 
    - % of errors maximum allowed is 1 %  i.e <= 1%
    - Support Vectors is >= 1% i.e atleast 1%

 => nu controls the #errors

 For run-time complexity, we want lesser #SVs
 but nu doesnt control the Support Vectors numbers as 
   \
    nu have upper bound on error
    but nu do not have any upper bound in SVs

=> Thus nu-SVM is 1 way to get understanding or an idea abt how many Support Vectors we may have.
   nu-SVM do not give control over support-vectors but can give some idea
