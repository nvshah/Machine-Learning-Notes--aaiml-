- Hyper-Param in SVR :- epsilon

=> RBF & SVR behaves much like KNN

Support Vector Regression
------------------------

- yi are real vals

SVC :- Yi in {1, -1}
SVR :- Yi in Real-Vals

1) Optimization Problem : (Simplest Formulation)
    
    min (0.5 * ||W||^2)
       \
        S.T. let Yi` = W^T*Xi + b
           \
            - Yi - Yi` <= epsilon
            - Yi` - Yi <= epsilon  (for all i)
            - epsilonn >= 0

    The above formulation can be kernalized to fit to diff type of shapes (other than plane)

    -> epsilon := Hyper-Parameter
    	\
    	 low :- errors are low on training data i.e => Chances of Overfitting incr
    	 high :- errors are high on training data  => Underfitting chances incr

=> Linear SVR :- can only fit planes, lines,...
=> Kernel SVR :- can fit to nonlinear shape

=> RBF & SVR behaves much like KNN 

* Constraints Explanation :
  --------------
   Q) How epsilon satisfy both way ???

   -> It is `epsilon tube` i.e epsilon from plane in both side

   As long as Yi` is in epsilon tube around base-Plane i.e Decision Surface, the constraints should
   work

---------
gist :-
   
   Thus in SVR :- only minimze the Regularization Term with some constraints
