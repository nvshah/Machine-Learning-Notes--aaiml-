* SVM :
_____

-> can do both classification & regression

Key Idea :- Find Hyper-plane that seperates points as widely as posible

=> Such plane is called as Margin-Maximizing Hyper-plane

-> We want to find the plane s.t. if we take 2 other planes parallel to this base plane
    ie one parallel plane touches boundary pt of 1 class
       other parallel plane touches boundary pt of another class

       The gape between 2 parallel plane is known as Margin

   So We should find such base plane s.t Gape between two parallel planes is maximize or 
   they are farther away as much as possible

SVM : tries to find Hyper-Plane that maximizes the Margin

    As Margin incr -> generalization accuracy improves


* Support Vector :
  ------------- 
    -> Pts through which parallel planes (to Margin-maximizing plane) or Boundary Planes pass through 
       are known as Support Vectors	

    -> The pts that are present on positive hyper-plane or negative hyper-plane are known as Support Vectors

    +ve Hyper-plane :- The boundnary plane that is nearest to +ve pts
    -ve Hyper-plane :- The boundary plane that is nearest to -ve pts

* Convex Hull Polygon :
  ------
   -> All the points must lie on the side or inside the polygon

   Connvex : A shape is said to be Connvex if pick any 2 points & bridget between those 2 points via 
             points lying in that shape only & that bridge path should be shortest path

             If some part of shortest path is outside the polygon region then its non-convex

   Convex Polygon :         
     If all the pts on the line connecting 2 points are inside polygon then it is called as Convex Polygon

   Convex Hull :
     build smallest convex polygon that has every pt inside or on the convex polygon

   Alternative Geometric interpretation Steps :
   --------------------------

     1) Convex Hull of +ve & -ve pts
     2) Find shortest line connecting these hulls
     3) Bisect the Line
          \
           The plane that bisect the line will be the Margin-Maximizing Plane

     So plane obtained via this way (alternative geom interpretation) will be same as The Plane obtained via standard way
