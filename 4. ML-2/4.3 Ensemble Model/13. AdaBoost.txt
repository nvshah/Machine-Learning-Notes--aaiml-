-----------

- For general purpose stuff GBDT is good algorithm

- GBDT is applied more than AdABoost esp at internet companies

___________

* AdaBoost
  -------

  -> Used primarily in Computer Vision or Image Processing like application

  Most successful application of AdaBoost :-
    - Face Detection
    - Image Detection

  CORE IDEA :- 
  --------
  Why Adaptive Boosting ?
   -> At every stage we are adapting to the errors that were made in prev stage
      & 
      we are giving more importance to the points which are being missclassified

  - spot error at each stage
  - provide more weight to those pts for next modelling so that model can be improved

  Process :
  ---
   - At each stage train model
     &
     grp where there are error do modify s.t 
       - increase weight of error i.e upsample or downsample technique (Weighted model)
     - modify or make weighted alteration to pts which are error.

   -> Typically You increase the weight exponentially

   - At each stage we determine model 
     &
     then at the end we will provide weight to each model i.e alpha_i

   => alpha in AdaBoost is same as gamma in GBDT


* Weighted Models :
  ---
   - one way to implement weighted model is to upsample

* Difference :
  ---
   In case of GBDT we use pseudo-resiuals, computed from the -ve gradient of loss func

   Whereas 

   in AdaBoost :-
     All the points which are errorneous are given more weightage using something called 
     adaptive boosting
