--------------
- Random Forest uses Regular DT

______________

-> In Normal RF :- there are 2 randomized term ie Row-Sampling & Col-Sampling

* Extremely Randomized Tree
  ---------
   - add 1 more level of randomization

   RF uses simple DT &
   in DT for real vals - we check for thresold for each val of feature

   So Normal DT - tries all possible val of feature Fi to determine the thresold (tou)

   Extremely Randomized Tree says instead of trying all possible val, try out a random sample of 
   possible value to determine the thresold

   ERT :- take bunch of vals instead of all

   So Extreme Randomized Tree is same as RF with 1 more modifications i.e randomization whilst selecting thresold

   col-sampling + row-sampling + aggregation + randomization whilst selecting `tou`

  => So Extreme Randomized Tree is small update over Random Forest
  		\
  		 (1 additional term of ranndomization)

  -> ET reduce variance slight better than RF (but may increase bias by little on other hand)

  => Because of Randomization is key idea in reducing variance in RF
     So by adding 1 more randomization term in ET, it will reduce Variance better comparitively to RF
