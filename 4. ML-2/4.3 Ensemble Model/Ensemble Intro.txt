Ensemble Intro


Core Idea : Combine Multiple basic model to get a single powerful model
-> To leverage multiple basic models (simple Models) & combine them intutively/ingeneously/creatively
   into more powerful model


* There are 4 types of Modeling :
    
    1) Bagging (BootStrapped Aggregation)
    2) Boosting
    3) Stacking
    4) Cacading

    All 4 techniques are high-performing & very powerful
    - Very useful in real world


=> The more different the basic Models are i.e (M1, M2, M3, ...)
    the better you can combine them into good poerful/creative Model ie. M
