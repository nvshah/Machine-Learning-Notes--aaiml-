Q) Maths : Diff between Partial Derivative & Grad (Inverted triangle symbol) ??

Q) Why using both Loss() term of prev stage & current stage model for computing gamma  
   inn Gradient boosting ??
   -> Won't it suffice if we only minimize or optimize the current stage model 
      i.e (model build on residuals) thereby minimizing the residuals
      & 
      if we minimize this then prev stage loss func will automatically be minimized !!
      as its only driving the residual ie pseudo residuals

   Sub-Que :-
      Prev stage Loss Func and current stage residual func are similar 
      then why we are reducing both 
      can't we minimze any one of them & thus will reduce other
