- Regression using DT also gives you Axis-Parallel lines only & not smooth curve

Regression & DT
---------------

-> For Regression normally we use MSE or MAD

-> So in DT for classificationn we can use IG but for regression we need to use something else

So For Regression 
 - we will use MSE or MAD instead of Entropy

 MSE :- mean((Y - Y`)^2)

 So We will go to that child node which has lower error compare to other with parent

 So We will split based on features & 
  Whichever feature reduces the error (ie MSE) we will select that fetaure

Thus :-

=< At any stage when we try to reduce/break dataset via feature 
	We are trying to reduce the error effectively
 
=> In case of classification :- Pick feature Fi - that reduces `entropy`
   
   In case of Regression :- Pick feature Fi - that reduces `error` (ie MSE)

   also Best Entropy = 0  // no randomness but totally deterministic
        Best Error  = 0  

Curve & DT-Regression :
---------------
=> Regression using DT also gives you Axis-Parallel lines only & not smooth curve 
   
   So DT regression is never smooth like curve 

-> DT is trying to approximate the curve with axis-parallel lines
