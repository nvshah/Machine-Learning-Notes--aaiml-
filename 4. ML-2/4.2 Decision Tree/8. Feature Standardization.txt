---------

- Knn, Log-reg, SVM are distance based model

---------

* Feature Standardization

=> DT is not distance based model

-> In decision tree, for numerical variable we do not care about the actual values themselves.
   but we care about the order i.e (ascending order)
     \
      fi < thresold  (eg)

   - Hence we do not need to do or perform feature standardization
    \
     => Simple reason is we dont care abt scaling 
        but we care abt smthng less than & smthng greater than certain thresold

=> so in DT, no need of Normalization, Standardization
   We can use raw val as it is.
   As we only care abt something less than or greater than
