4. Information Gain

Formula :- 
	Information_Gain = [Entropy(parent)] â€“ [Weighted Average Entropy of child nodes] 

	I(Y, f) = H_D(Y) - sum(Di/D * H_Di(Yi))  
	  \
	   Y is predicted varaible
	   f - feature on split
	   H_D = total entropy of parent
	   H_Di = entropy of child nodes

	Info Gain breaking dataset using feature for Y
