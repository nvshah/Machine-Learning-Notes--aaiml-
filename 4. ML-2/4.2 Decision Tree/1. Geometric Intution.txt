- Axis Parallel Hyper-Planes ;- DT is all abt Axis Parallel Hyper-planes

------------


1. Geometric Intution

-> Convert nested if-else into diagram of Tree structure

   Tree :- 
   	- For all internal node/vertex (ie non-leaf node) we will make some decisions
   	- leaf vertex/node will be terminating point for making decision 
   	  & we will decide what class label to give

-> DT model are highly interpretable as we can read as its a program

Geometric :
-----
 - corresp every decision we will have hyper-plane

 - For simple DT, all the hyper-plane are parallel to either axis i.e axis-parallel-hyper-plane

 -> So DT is nothing but set of axis-parallel-hyper-planes that divide your regions into cube, 
    cuboid, ...

Programatically :- 
	DT = nested if-else

Read Tree :- via following path through edges

* Challange :- Construct DT
   
    Constructing DT is not-trivial
      \
       but later part post constructing DT is trivial
