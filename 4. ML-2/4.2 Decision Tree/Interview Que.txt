    You are working on a time series data set. You manager has asked you to build a high accuracy model. You start with the decision tree algorithm, since you know it works fairly well on all kinds of data. Later, you tried a time series regression model and got higher accuracy than decision tree model. Can this happen? Why?(Refer :https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/09/40-interview-questions-asked-at-startups-in-machine-learning-data-science/)
    Running a binary classification tree algorithm is the easy part. Do you know how does a tree splitting takes place i.e. how does the tree decide which variable to split at the root node and succeeding nodes?(Refer:https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/09/40-interview-questions-asked-at-startups-in-machine-learning-data-science/)
