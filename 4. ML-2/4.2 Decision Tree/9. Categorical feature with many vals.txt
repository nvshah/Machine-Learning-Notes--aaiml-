* Categorical feature with many possible vals
  -------------
   - many possible discrete vals
   
   Eg feature = pincode/zipcode
        \
         numerical but still cant compare them easily

      - each pincode can be category

-> Categories of categorical features are also called as Levels

- some of splitted dataset gets very small from early depth level

* hacks :-
  ----
   1) Convert categorical feature to numerical feature 
       \
        P(Yi=1 | Pj)

      2 feature having same probability = having them as numerical feature is useful
