=> Computing logs take more time complexity than computing squares

_______________

Gini Impurity
-----------

- similar to entropy

I_g(Y) = 1 - sum(pow(P(yi),2))

- Gini Impurity is similar to Entropy if we look via graph except that some scaling factor between 
  both

  Gini Impurity has no log term & 

 => Computing logs take more time complexity than computing squares

 => So Gini Impurity is computationally efficiennt than Entropy  & so
    Its used in place or as a proxy to Entropy nowadays
