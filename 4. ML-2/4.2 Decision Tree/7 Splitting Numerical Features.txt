- In DT we ought to use >, <, <=, >= ie if-else conditions quite lot

* Splitting Numerical Features

- For categorical or discrete R.V its simple to split !!

Q) What if features is Numerical - (int or real valued) ?? 

  - sort the feature in ascending order  [ // O(nlg(n)) ]

  (For single feature)
  - we can have then n possible constraints variations for split ie
       f1 < t1   // t1 = first val
       f1 < t2   // t2 = second val 

          t : thresold

       We can have such n variations

    So we check through n possible splitting criteria
    -> this is quite time consuming & non-trivial

  - pick best among all variations

-------

  Thus for d features we will need to sort all such d features 1 by 1 :- ( d * n * lg(n) )
