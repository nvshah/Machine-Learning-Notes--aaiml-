Mathematics Notes (Extra 1)

-> Good Mathematics Function :
   -------
    -> sin(x)/x
       cos(x) - sin(x)

-> e is special constant which is called base of natural logarithm

-> Never make conclusion from Junk (Random data)

-----------------------------------------------

-> Bisection Method vs Newton-Raphson :
   -----------------------
   	Bisection Method -> Divide & Conquer
   	Newton Raphson Method -> Derivative

    -> How quick you are converging towards your goal [Newton-Raphson is best]

-> Gradient Method (For Convergence)

-> Feynman's method

-> ROC (Reciever Operation and Center) & AUC (Area Under Curve)

-> Integration problem can be break into discrete problem

   Integration is nothing but finding AUC via very minute delta or via large numbers of intervals between 2 point

   dx -> very minute delta of x

   Integration is Continuous, Summation is Discrete

=> Pareto Distribution has Infinite mean & variance

=> Area of Circle using Trapezoid Rule

=> Log is called a monotonnic function

=> Hyper-Plane is all about defining its Normal

=> To solve the optimization problem you need function to be differentiable

=> Inn optimization Problem, the point for which f(x) is minimum is the point for which -f(x) will be maxim
