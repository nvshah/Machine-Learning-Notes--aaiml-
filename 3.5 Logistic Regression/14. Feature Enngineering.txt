14 NonLinear Seperable


----------------------------

=> The most imp aspect of Machine Learning is Feature Engineering

-> Whole of Applied ML is Feature Engineering

-> Feature transformation is Art of ML 

---------------------------


-> When data are nonlinarly seperable :
  ------
   - drawing a plane cannnot seperate inn such scenario

   Eg Co-Centric Circles


- Feature Transformation or Engineering :
  --------------------------------
   -> Transform the features 
    - Transform your features may be to diff space

   -> When you have crazy data, F.E. toss its way

    ie let say 2 features f1 & f2
       then
         f1 -> f1` = f1^2  // transform
         f2 -> f2` = f2^2
  
   -> In a nutshell, We are having diff feature space than from original one

  Q) How to know Which Feature transformation to apply ??

   -> By practice & observation


  Eg 1) If the data pt are distributed in Co-Centric Circle fashion :
        - then We know that 
              f1^2 + f2^2 = r  // this is not a linear eqn but quadratic form (as exponent is 2)

              but if we take f1^2 = f1` & f2^2 = f2`  // ie take f1^2 & f2^2 as new axis
              then

              f1` + f2` = r  // this is probably linear eqn (as exponent is 1)

 => The most imp aspect of ML is 
      1) feature-engineering 
      2) Bias-Variance TradeOff
      3) Data Analysis


  Eg 2) * XOR data Pattern :
        --------------
      -> Cannot seperate such data using linear surface

       f1` = f1 * f2
       f2` = f2

       All positive pt on 


  Eg 3) Alternating +ve & -ve pts group
       --------------
        -> cannot seperate with any hyper-plane

       f1` = sin(f1)
       f2` = f2

       (Assuming the width of sin wave is equal with alternating class/grp width)


* Typical Transformations of Real-Valued Features :
  -------------------------------

   1) Polynomial Feature Transformation 
          \
           f1, f1^2, f1^3, ..

           - product of features : f1*f2, ...

   2) Trigonometric :
          \
           Sin(F1), Cos(F1)

           - combination : sin(f1)^2

  When you have boolean features :

   3) Boolean :
         \
          OR, AND, XOR, NOT, ...

   4) Log()

   5) exponentiation : e^()


-> In Amazon Review System also BOW, TFIDF, Word2Vec are all Feature Enginerring Technique
