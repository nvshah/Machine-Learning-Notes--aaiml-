Q) What is diff between Log-Loss Func & Sigmoid Func ??
 
  -> Sigmoid Func is understand from Geometric Perspective & it's used as to output the predictions
     Logistic Loss is approximation to 0-1 Loss Function in case of Optimization Problem Solving

  -> Logistic Loss is nothing but Log applied to Sigmoid Func with some mathematics manipulation
      \
       So we can say that 

  -> Logistic Loss uses Sigmoid Func to find best Weight Vector
  -> Log Loss is used in case of probabilistic prediction

  So at the end When Correct Weight Vector are found :- We will sigmoid Function only for Predictions


Q) For Making Inferences or Predictions, Does Sigmoid Function is used ?
    \
     or Sigmoid Func is Just Used While preparing Models only (During Training phase) ?

     So if we want Class label only (not interpretation) then do we need Sogmoid Func during inference ?
     -> No because we can derive that via Signed Distance


Q) Why grad updation involves addition & not subtraction ??
  
  -> Because Loss Function in case of Logistic Regression (ie LogLoss) is Convex Optimization Problem Function necessarily
     So instead of Gradient Descent - Gradient Ascent kind of thing is emulated	
     
     [Remember]
     When Convex Optimization Problem :- It's gurantee to have only 1 Minima (global)

  -> the tangent direction at any point is in upwards direction so we put - since we need to descent.By default its gradient ascent.

  - ake the function y = x*x. Assume y is Loss for a value x and Plot it and apply gradient descent by starting at x= 3 manually by hand calculating the gradient and changing the x parameter. This will really help you understand this better.


Q) 2 ways to solve Logistic Regression :
   
	- LogisticRegression()  // via log probabilities  (Probabilistic Way)
	- SGDClassifier         // generalized Linear Model
