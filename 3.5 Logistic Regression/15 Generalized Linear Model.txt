15 Generalized Linear Model

-> Log-Reg = Gaussian Naive bayes + Bernoulli R.V  // probabilistic interpretation of Log-Reg

------------

* Poission Distribution :- 
    - count random variable
    - If you want count #occurences of an event

-------------
* Generalized Linear Model :
  ----
   -> Logistic Regression is a type of GLM which is used for 2 class classification

   If you want your Bernoulli Distb to different scheme then we will get GLM

=> In probabilistic interpretation, if you change the Bernoulli Distb to another or slightly then 
   you will get different variations
   of Logistic Regression

   1) Bernoulli -> Multinomial Distribution

       -> MultiClass Classification Problem
          MultiNomial Logistic Regression   // for multiple classes

   2) Bernoulli -> Gaussian Normal Distb

       -> Linear Regression
       - If you assume P(Y|X) -> N(mean, std_dev) then it will be Linear Regression

   3) Bernoulli -> Poission Distribution

       -> Poission Regression
           \
       	- predict Counts

       	Poision Random Variable :-
        Eg Predict #times a machine would fail in next 10 days
           How many times earthquake happens
           count number of visitors for a restaurant
