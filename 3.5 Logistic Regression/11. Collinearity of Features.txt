11. Collinearity of Features :

* Collinear Features :
  -------------
   representing 1 feature as a linear combination of another feature

    f1 = a1X1 + b

* MultiCollinear Features :
  -------------
   representing 1 feature as a linear combination of multiple feature

    f1 = a1X1 + a2X2 + b


* Pertubation Technnique :
  ------------
   (Shake it a little)

   -> Add a little noise (random) to all the values in a matrix 

      Noise be come from some random variable N(0, 0.002)

   Step1) Before Pertubation calculate the Weight vector W* i.e <w1, w2,...>

   Step2) Perform Pertubation ie add noise to data in matrix

   Step3) After Pertubation Calculate again Weight Vector W` i.e <w1`, w2`,...>

         Now compare W*  <w1, w2, ... >
                     W`  <w1`, w2`,...>

         - If both vector weights differ significantly then both are collinear
           \
            So you cannot use abs(Wi) for feature importance
