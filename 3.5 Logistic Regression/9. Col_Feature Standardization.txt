* Standardization :
_____________

Xij = Xij - mean / std_dev

=> In Logistic Regression, its mandatory to compute the col-standardization

   Why ?
   -> because we are computing distances to hyper-plane
      &
      wherever distances occur, Scaling may cause an issue so we need standardization

      Scale of features could impact a result (ie di)
        - It may result in less accurate distance
        - It may slow down the loss-func minima optimization process
           \
            slow convergence

   -> Hence we standardize fetaures

=> Col/Feature Standardization is also called as mean-centering & scaling


* Normalization :
  ----
   -> You can also consider normalization in alternative to Standardization
