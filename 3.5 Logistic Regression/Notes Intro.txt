TOPIC :- { Intro Math Concepts, Optimization Problem }

--------------------

-> Log-Reg can be studied in 3 ways { geometry, probability, loss function }

=> Every Model makes some assumptions

=? W* means Optimial W

=> Normal to a Hyperplane tells abt the Hyperplane
   For every Plane there is Unique W (ie Normal)

---------------------

* Logistic Regression : (Geometrically)

=> Log-Reg can be studied in 3 ways { geometry, probability, loss function }

-> It's a classification technique.
- geomteric oriented
- Linearly Seperable | almost linearly seperable
- Binary

Line/Plane  - Linearly Surfaces
Circle/Parabola - Quadratic Surfaces

=> For a given plane there is always Normal Perpendicular to plane
   & 
   Plane can be represented by its Normal & intercept term
   (When plane passes through originn, interept = 0)

--------

Assumption of Log Reg :- Classes are almost/perfectly linearly Seperable

Task in Log reg :- Find Plane (ie W & b) S.T it seperates the Data Pts.

Binary can be {0, 1} or {-1, 1}

=> Decision Surface in Logostic Regression is a Line or a Plane ie Linear Surface

------

- distance of a pt from any given plane can be given as 
      d_i := (W^T * X)  // assuming W as normal unit vector 

   So if d_i > 0   // same side of normal W  (+ve)
         d_i < 0   // opp side of normal W   (-ve)

         So sign of distance will be the aid to classifier in this case

   Let Say Binary Classifier i.e {1, -1}

   So if  Yi * d_i > 0  // Yi is then correctly identified
     \
      As in both +ve/-ve case Yi & d_i will have same sign so at the end +ve result

      if  Yi * d_i < 0 // Yi is not correctly classifying the points (may be those are outliers)

   Eventually We want Classifier to be very good 
          :- min num of miss classification
             max num of correct classification

   So Task = Find Plane s.t. Yi * (W^T * X) > 0  is maximized, Given a Training Dataset

               maximize means := (as many +ve as possible & as few -ve as possible)

   In Yi * (W^T * X) -> W is variable whereas (Xi, Yi) is fixed ie positions

   So In a nutshell Task is Optimization Problem 

=> Optimization Problem :- find W that optimize i.e maximize above eqn

   (NOTE below optim func is just 1st intution but its incorrect & not optimal) 

   - W* means Optimal W in Optimization Problem

     W* = argmax([sum(Yi * d_i)])  // [] is calc with diff W i.e Wj :- so need to find j ie argmax()
           \
            that W which maximizes 

   -> Thus Objective :- find maximal W (ie W*) in turn such a plane that maximize the eqn Yi * d_i


    also optimization involves updation for intercept term b as well
