DL Math useful Note 1

----------------

* Function Composition & MLP :
  -------
   -> MLP is just graphical way to represent the Function Composition
   
   Funnction Composition :- 
       F(G(x)) 
       G(F(x))  // G of F of x


* Hill Descent :
  --------


* Polynomial of Matrices :
  -----
  -> It suggests what is max path length possible between given 2 vertices !

  In Graph Theory,
  -> Polynomial such as A^1, A^2, A^3, ... A^k
      \
       helps to decide what can be max path length from vertext Vi -> Vk


* Laplacian (Maths)
  ----
  You can think Laplacian as modified version of Adjacency Matrix
  - Capture both Degree & Neighborhood Information

  L := D - A
