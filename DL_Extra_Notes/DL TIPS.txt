DL TIPS

=> while doing it keras & tensorflow way, you can use Violin Plots to see distribution of Weight among diff Hidden Layers

=> Data Augmentation is esp used for Image Dataset 
   \
    used mostly in CNN

=> Initial layers in CNN often deal with the task of detecting the Borders, Common Shapes & Likewise
   (which is common among all tasks esp when we talk about Images)

=> Keep Small Learning Rates when you FineTune Your Model

=> Machine Translation esp have long term dependencies

=> Padding primarily meant for Batch Update, in LSTM (thus it can speed up update process)

=> TensorFlow/Keras :- allows to add diff regularization at diff layers

* Dropout & Conv Layer & Fully Connected Layer :
  -------
  -> compare to 2 Conv layer, chances of dropout being present between 2 fully connected layers is more
     because
     there are more weights variable between 2 FC-layers, comparatively
     So need some sort of Regularization

=> If you are overfitting the model then add the dropout

=> Better tip is to add Dropout after every Fully Connection Layer !!

*) BLUE Score :- specialized metric for transformation of sentences mesaurement


-> Whenever you see Sequence/Timer-Series Data you must always click about
   - RNN, Attention, Transformer, LSTM, etc...

   Whenever you see about Image Data
   - CNN,

=> Whenver You have small amount of Data -> You must look for Transfer Learning

   Few Samples of Data => Transfer Learning

=> Whenever you have audio data consider using Spectograms (instead of Fourier Transforms)

-> Gradient Clipping : is used primararily to avoid exploding gradient problem in Recurrent NN
