----------
TIPS

 - Never make conclusion from Junk (Random data)
 
 - TSNE is a randomized algo (slightly diff output when result multiple times)

------

-> most powerful technique

-> PCA tries to preserve Global Shape of Data
   PCA doesnt care much abt local structure (i.e distances between points)

   Tsne can choose to preserve local structure (i.e neighbourhood)

=> Stchoastic == Probabilistic

-----------------------------------

TSNE = Probabilistic Neighbourhood Embedding

* Neighbourhood 
  -----
   -> close to point (geometrically)

* Embedding :
  ----
   -> For every point in high dimension space If its corresponding point in lower-dimension
      can be found then it is called embedding

* T-Sne :
  ---
   - try to preserve the neighbourhood

  => Note you cannot perfectly embed the points

  Crowding Problem :
  ---
   - proof by contradiction
   - sometimes its impossible to preserve the distance in all N

   -> T-distb is used to ameliorate the above problem to some extent at its best

* Iterative Algorithm :
  -------

  TSne is an iterative algo (just like Clustering)
     \
      At every stage it tries to improve embeddings

     1) steps  = # iterations 
     2) perplexity - # near points (no of neighbours)

     => tradeoff between perplexity & steps is to be decided

     NOTE :- 
       - always run TSNE for multiple value of perplexity val
       - try to keep #-perplexity < #-points
       - plot TSNE for various val of steps(iteration) to check if shape is stabilizing
       - once find right perplexity & steps, fixed & run it for multiple times.
          (as TSNE is not deterministic algorithm)

       - Never conclude by just looking 1 perplexity value

       When we use perplexit = number of points It's try to preserve whole structure (which is often not possible)

* Stochastic NE :
  ------------
   It means that probabilistic

  => Tsne is not a deterministic algorithm but its a probabilistic/stochastic algorithm

  * Deterministic Algo : every time for same input provide same output


 * Interesting Drawback of Tsne:
   -----
    -> one of the thing what Tsne does is
        - expands the dense cluster
        - shrinks the sparse cluster

    -> drawback of tsne is that it cannot say about density/sparseness (i.e size) of cluster.

    -> Tsne doesn't preserve distances between cluster
    
    -> Random data makes sense when used 1 perplexity value
    :- Never make conclusion from Junk & Random data is junk

    -> TSne never exactly replicate the results


* TSne Intution :
  ------
   - geometrically it helps us to get understanding of topology (i.e shape)

      Eg trefoil Knot
         Interlocked chain


    1) run steps/iter till shapes stabilize
    2) peplexity i.e  2 <= p <= n
    3) re-run t-sne p-step till stable or not


* TSne & Mnist :
  -----
   -> Visual Similarity Grouping 
      group point based on their visual similarity
