Tips 1

-> Always look at the plots (& Observe it & identify something)
   Always read the scale of a Plot

-> To plot any func -> just google -> `plot f(x)`   // replace whatever function with f(x)

-> To find lower & upper bound of interval in array (increasing order) :- use numpy.percentile()
     let say we want {p%} of interval

     lower bound = ((1 - p) / 2) * 100  percentile 
     upper bound = p   percentile


-> Norm of Xi vector square = Xi.transpose * Xi

-> Never make conclusion from Junk (Random data)

-> Use common sense to clean data

=> Given any problem if you can convert it to Vector then we can leverage power of Linear Algebra

=> To solve the optimization problem you need function to be differentiable

=> Langrange Multiplier is helpful to solve the constrained Optimization problem

=> The sparsity do not depends on the loss but on regularizer

->-> To solve Real-World Problem more robustly, deal with Outliers very efficently

-> Dot Product = Cosine Similarity (assuming norm =1)

-> abs() is not differentiable at x=0

-> Read Lots of Literature in ML for understanding Data & finding correct featurization

=> Best way to learn the Image Data is CNN Deep Learning Algo

=> Penalized Terms in yout equation when you think some have nore impact than others
