Python Tips :
-----------

- use `module.` notation when using module (i.e namespace imported)
- keep take care of identation

- never compare `math.nan` with a number

- Python uses bignum underhood to store int so it can hold arbitarily large digits

________________________________________________
 
1) to get version of python :-  `sys.version`

2) To represent non--number :- `math.nan`

   To check if nan :-  `math.isnan(o)`


3) To remove tags from text document :- use bs4.BeautifulSoup() with lxml as parser

4) To get byte file size :- os.stat()

5) Most Frequent items in List :- Counter() data structure

6) To get all subfolders :- os.listdir()

7) To remove folder & all its content :- shutil.rmtree()

numpy + ML modules

=> Instead of using sparse array to store values
   Use  dict where key is tuple & value is value that would be present in sparse array actually

* Numerical Underflow :
  --
   -> When floating point precison exceeds the 16 places after point then it is called Numerical Underflow
      Then python starts rounding the number

=> To deal with Numerical Underflow, one of the way is to use Log of the Variable i.e
   As Log is Monotonic & does not change the Order of a numbers

=> Whenever you have categorical features, You can consider missing val as one other category ie (NAN)

=> To compute SIFT features :- use openCV python library

* Pickleing :
