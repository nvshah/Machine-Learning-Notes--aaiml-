gist Tips

=> So when you onnly need the Similarity between Pairs of Points, You can trivially Kernalize it

* Agglomerative Clustering :- is all abt Proximity Matrix Findings (via diff approach)

* Dendogram :- help us to get any nnummber of cluters 
               (ie Hyper-param search is inherently done in hierarchical clustering)


* K-means vs Hirearchical :
  ----
   K-means can easily be sacle to large dataset
   whereas
   Hierarchical clustering cannot easliy scale to large dataset 
        (because of its heavy time & space complexity)
