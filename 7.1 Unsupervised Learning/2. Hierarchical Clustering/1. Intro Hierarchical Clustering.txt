* Intro Hierarchical Clustering
  ----
---------
-> So in case of Hirearchical clustering you can jumpt between any K clusters easily 

---------

-> There are 2 kind of Hierarchical Clustering 1) Agglomerative & 2) Divisive

* Agglomerative :
  --------
   - grouping together to form a large part

   - initially it assumes each point as individual cluster
   - then it combines nearest cluster into 1 group
      \
       It iteratively combine the nearest cluster into single group
       It incrementally keeps combining the cluster which are close together

       Combining or grouping will happen based on some similarity technique
       \
        Key ingredients :- simmilarity between clusters

   -> At the end we will get single cluster 

   - Its alike Union & find Union operation

   -> starts from n to 1


* Divisive :
  -------
   -> Its reverse/opposite to Agglomerative

   - It starts from single cluster & go towards tiny cluster ie 1 to n

=> agglomerative is more popular than Divisive
   \
    because trying to group things together based on similarity is easier than 
            trying to break or divide things

=> Thus Agglemorative :- merge
        Divisive      :- splits


* Tree & Hierarchical Significance :
  --------
   You can represent either Agglomerative or Divisive as a `Dendogram`

   Tree like structure that records the sequence of merges or splits.
    \
     Hierarchy of merges at diff level

* No Hyper-parameters :
  -----
   => There is no need to give #clusters as hyper-parameter
       \
       Hyper-parameter search is inherently done in this kind of algo

=> So in case of Hirearchical clustering you can jumpt between any K clusters easily
