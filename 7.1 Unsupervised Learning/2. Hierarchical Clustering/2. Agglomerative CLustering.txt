2. Agglomerative CLustering
------

* Proximity matrix :
  ------
   Similarity between 2 Clusters

   - Key idea in Agglomerative Clustering

-> Whichever cluster you merge the corresp row & col need to be updated 


* Proximity decider :
  -----

1) Min :
   ---
    (Single Linkage Algoritm)

    -> pick 2 closest point between 2 clusters ie inter-cluster distance is minimum

    * Outliers/Noise :
      -----
       noise also gets involved in one of the clusters, often
       - Tendency to grab/merge noise into clusters

2) Max :
   ---
    (Complete Link Algorithm)

    -> Pick 2 farthest point between 2 clusters 

    * Noise :- Less prone to noise & outliers

    When you have large clusters, 
      - MAX tends to break large clusters

    - biased towards globular (globe-like) structure

3) Group average :
   ---
    -> Take all the pairs between 2 cluster & take average

    - Nice Compromise between Single & Complete Link algorithm
    - it takes into account min distance & max disatnce as well

4) Distance between Centroids:
   ----
    -> It's slightly harder to kernalize
       because centroids are not point from dataset only

=< Note :- everything will get involved in

[Kernalize]
---
=> In all above, all you need is Similarity between pairs of points 
   So when you onnly need the Similarity between Pairs of Points, You can trivially Kernalize it


* Ward's Method :
  -----------
   -> Similar to Group Average where instead of distance, distance-squared is used

=> Thus in case of agglomerative clustering its all abt findings Proximity Matrix via diff
