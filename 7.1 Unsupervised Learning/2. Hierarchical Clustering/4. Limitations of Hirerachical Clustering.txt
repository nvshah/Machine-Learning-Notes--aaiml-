* Limitations of Hirerachical Clustering

1) No mathematical objective function
   ---
    -> No mathematical objective formulation for what we are solving !

    If something can be represented with mathematical objective function then we can 
    link it with different algorithms

2) Deciders 
   ---
    Min :- Outliers
    Max :- breaks large clusters
           can't accomodate the different size clusters
    grouping avg :- also has some problem as its combinnation of above two

3) Complexities :
   -----
    It is the most imp drawback of hierarchical clustering

    -> space & time complexity if Hierarchical Clustering are bottleneck
    -> cannot scale to large dataset

    K-means has O(nd) which is linear
     -> thus k-mean clustering can easily be scale to large data whereas agglomerative clustering cannot

    -> this limitation cannot be workaround very easily
