* Clustering
  --------

Recap :-
   In classification & Regression, you try to find a function(features) at holistic way
   & yi's are given

In clustering,
   - only yi's are given
   - only features are given

Task => is to group data points that are 'similar'

* Similar Points : (Naive Idea)
  ----
   - Points which are near to each other (same cluster) & 
     far away from other points (diff cluster)

   - Actually Similar Points are Problem/Task Specific


Q) How to measure how well your Algo Model performs ??
 -> bunch of metrics won't work !! (because all metrics require Yi)
  

* Diff Techniques of Clustering :
  -----
   1) K-Means
   2) Hierarchical
   3) DB-Scan

-----

* Unsupervised Algorithms : Clustering / Grouping
    \
     - no Yi's to supervised learning

  Supervised Learning : Regression / Classification
    \
     - we have class-labels or regressible values to supervised our model learning process

  Semi-Supervised Learning :
  ----
   In such case consider Data D = D1 union d2
           where D1 -> has {X, Y}
                 D2 ->     {X}

   - small portion of the data has labels or regressible-vals, 
     whereas large portion of data do not 

   - so small number of data points can guide out during learning process

   - This may happen mostly when labelling thee data-points is very expensive
