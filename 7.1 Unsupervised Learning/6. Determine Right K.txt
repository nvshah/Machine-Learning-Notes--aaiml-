* Determine Right K
  -----------------

 -> In K-means or K-mediod, K is Hyper-Parameter :

 Ways :

1) Domain-Knowledge : 

2) Elbow-Method or Knee Method :
   --------------------
    -> plot loss vs K plots & find the best k as we do earlier in Cross-Validation


noTE :-
  In case if Cross Validation we do have ground truth so we can compare & validate
  In case of Clustering, no ground truth so we employ Knee-method (just based on Data )


* Hyper-Parameter Selection : (Elbow Method )
  ---------
   Loss vs K

   -> Plot :- is monotonically decreasing as k increases

   -> as k increases, the loss decreases or dramatically decreases & then after some point it
      changes it rate of fall

   -> So elbow point is the one where steepness of falling changes 
   		or
   		There is sudden change in direction or rate of change in fall

   -> Pick elbow point where there is sudden change (ie kinda slope has change)

   (Consider Human Elbow)

   In the case of K-mean, the plot will be sommething like constantly decreasing as k increases

   at k = n, it will be 0
      \
       because k=n means every point is itself cluster & in that case distance of point from itself is 0 => thus loss is 0 for every cluster
