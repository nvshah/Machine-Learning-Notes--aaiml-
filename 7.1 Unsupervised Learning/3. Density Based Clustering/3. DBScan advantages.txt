* DBScan advantages
  --------

plus :
---
 - Resistant to Noise
 - Can handle Cluster of different sizes


minus :
---
 - Varying Densities : 
       - small change in EPS leads to dramatically change in Cluster output

 -> Extremely Sensitive to Hyper-Parameter (esp Epsilon)

 -> High-dimen Data :- (Euc-Dist) :- Cures of Dimensionality Problem

 (Minor change in EPS - heavy change in clustering result)
