* DBScan Algo
--------------

-> Sklearn migh be using KDTree in their internal structure for DBScan algo
__________

=> If the distance Di is high for Xi for mth nearest point (ie m is the min-pt cnt)
   then chances of point being noisy are more

________

=> Hyper-Params : Min-Pts, Epsilon

1) Range Queries :
  --------------
   Si = rangeQuery(Xi, Epsilon, D)   // D is Dataset

   - range-query gives you the set of points around Xi in epslion range
     (internally range-queries might be using KD-tree or similar like structure)

   [Noise Point]
2) Remove all the Noise Points

   [Core Point]
3) For each core Point P (ie not assigned to any Cluster)
     
     (a) create a new cluster with this unassigned core point
     (b) add all pts that are density connected to p into this new cluster

   (REPEAT this 3rd step untill all core points gets assigned to some cluster)

   [Border Point]
4) Each Border Point (assignment)
    - assign each border point to closest core point's cluster

=> MIMP operation in DBScan is RangeQuery

-> RangeQuery can be performed in O(log n)


* Hyper-Params :
  ------------

  1) Min-Pts :
     ---
     Task :- Choose the Min Point   

      // given Point Xi have d-dimension
      - (Rule of Thumb) := Min-Pts >= d+1
      
      (a) Approximation

      	=> Typically Min-Pts := 2*d          // is chosen

      (b) Larger Min-Pts
      	  
      	=> If dataset has more noise points
             Larger Min-Pt -> helps to remove or deduct the effect of noisy points

      (c) Domain Expert

     	=> min-pts by domain-expert
  
  2) EPS :
     ---
      Let min-pt decided = m
      then,

      - for pt Xi find the distance di of m_th nearest neaighbor of Xi
      - do for all the points & arrange the di in increasing order

      Elbow/Knee method :
      _____
       - can be used to determine the EPS
         Where,
         As {di} increases, the chances of Point {Xi} beinng Noisy also increases

         So you need to find the inflection point or Knee-Point from where there is sudden 
         increases in Di for corresp Xi
         whereafter most of the points can be regarded as noisy points
