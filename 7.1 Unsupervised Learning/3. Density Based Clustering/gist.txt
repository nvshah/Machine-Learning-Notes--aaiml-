* Density Based Clustering :
  ------

  DBScan :
  ----
   - DBScan was developed by Database & DataMining Community so that RangeQueries can 
     be highly optimized inside Database & can be used effectively
     
   2 hyper-params :- Min-Pts, Epsilon

     Min- Pts :- decide the dense or sparse regions
     Epsilon  :- help to find the density of point 

   Points :- Core Point, Border Point, Noise Point
   other ideas :- Density edge, Density Connection Point

   DBScan Algo : uses above ideas & 2 hyper-param


* Range Query :
  ----
   -> most imp part of DBScan algo to find the dense & sparse cluster 

* Hyper-Param deciding :
  -----
   1) Min-Pts :- via Approximation or Expert-Domain
   2) Epsilon :- Via Elbow/Knee Method
                 (as Di increases the chances of noisy also increases)
