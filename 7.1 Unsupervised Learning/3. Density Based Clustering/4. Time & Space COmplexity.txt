Time & Space COmplexity

Time 
---
:- roughly :- O(n log(n))
    
    log n :- range query
    n :- for n points 

    so n * log(n) ie n times range query performed

   => Range-Query Can be Optimized using KD-Tree or Oct-Tree

Space :- 
---
 O(n)

 Thus when dataset is very high dimensional it can cause problem

-------

 1. K-means has roughly Time Complexity of O(n)

 2. Hierarchical :- O(n^2 logn)
