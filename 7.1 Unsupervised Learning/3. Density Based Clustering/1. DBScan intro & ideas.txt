- Hyper-Params : Min-Pts, epsilon  // for DbScan Algo

* Density based Clustering :
  ----
	   -> Dense & Sparse regions seperation -> clusters 

1. DBScan intro
--------------
-> One of the scheme of Density based Clustering

- DBScan was developed by Database & DataMining Community so that RangeQueries can 
  be highly optimized inside Database & can be used effectively

- Goal : Try to seperate the Dataset based on Dense Regions & Sparse Regions

-> Typically Dense regions becomes different cluster
   &
   Dense regions often get seperated by sparse regions

-> Sparse regions typically contains noisy points


Q) How to Measure Density ??
  ---
   - Min pts, epsilon, Core-pt, border-pt, noise-pt, density-edge, density connection pts


* Measuring Density : 
 __________________
  
  There are 2 params :- min-pts & epsilon 

  these 2 params are hyper-parameter of DBscan algo
 
  - epsilon => help to define the density of point
  - min-pts => help to identify dense or sparse regions

  -> Min-Pts :- points require to form a dense regions

  1) Density :
    -----
  	- For given pt p : density = #surrounding pts in radius range of {epsilon}

  2) Dense Regions :
    ------
    - for given point p: if region of epsilon around it has more than {min-pts}
                         then it is said to be lying in dense regions

                         if that region has less than min-pt then it is called as sparse region

    => Thus dense regions is region that contains atleast min-points


* Core Point
  __________

   -> Given min-pts & epsilon & Dataset D

   For any point p, if p has >= min-pts in its surrounding of epsilon range then p is called as core point

   core-point :- lying in core of region ie 
               -> Lye inside dense region

* Border Point :
  ____________

   -> Given min-pts & epsilon & Dataset D

   point p is said to be border-point iff:
   
   1) P is not core point (ie it has < min-pts in its epsilon range)
   2) p is neighbor of other core point let say o (ie distance between o & p is < epsilon)


* Noise Point :
  ____________
   -> Point which is neither a Core Point nor a Border Point are called a Noise Points


* Density Edge :
  ___________
   
   Edge between 2 points s.t.

     - 2 points are core points 
     - distance between those 2 points is <= {epsilon}

* Density Connected Points :
  ________________

   2 points P & Q are said to be Density Connected Points iff:

    - a path of density edges exists between 2 core points 
      (Note :- all the vertex in that path are also the core points)

      So path length will always be multiple of epsilon
