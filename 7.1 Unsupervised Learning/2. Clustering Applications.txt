* Clustering Applications
  --------

=> Clustering was not algorithmm intended or rooted from ML perspective
   instead it was actyally used lot in data mining application

1) ECommerce :
  ------
   Eg Amazon, Flipkart

    Group Customers based on the behaviour
    - so as later they can be offered with deals, offers per diff groups


2) Image Segmentation or Computer Vision :
   -------
    - all abt grouping or clustering similar pixels to segment objects
    - typically apply ML-ago to perform object detection

    Computer vision or Image Processijg involves the Image Segmentation


3) amazon review polarity : (Manual labelling)
   ---------------
    - after reading review someone has given polarity (either +ve or -ve)

    -> assume there are 1M reviews then it would be very expensive as it require lot of man power

    => Manual labeling is Time Consuming & Expensive
       So in cases like this Clustering can be applied 

    - Whenever Manual Labeling is Time Consuming & Very Expensive, Clustering can be used as a
      pre-processing step to group the data points
      afterwhich manual labellingn can be performed with less efforts comparatively (via observing the few data points from each group)
