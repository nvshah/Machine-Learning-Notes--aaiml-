3. Metrics for Clustering

------------

* Ground truth :- class-labels | regression values // in case of supervised learning

-------------

In Supervised Learning :-
    Class Labels or regression values is called as ground truth


* Intra Cluster := with in the same cluster
  Inter Cluster := between the 2 cluster

  So ideally to form a basis for good clustering it should be S.T.
    - Intra-Cluster distance between points is small
      &
      Inter-Cluster distance between points is large

* Dunn-index :
  ---------
   D = maximal_inter_cluster_distance ie d(i,j) / maximal_intra_cluster_distance d`(k)

   if dunn index high -> good clustering

   - numerator :- distance between c_i & c_j clusters for farthest points

     denominnator :- 1) take farthest distance among 2 points belonging to same cluster
                     2) do this for all cluster
                     3) pick the clustering distance with largest intra-cluster distance between 2 points within that cluster

   -> Thus Dunn index works considering Worst Case in both inter & intra cluster scenarios
      (why worst because its considerign the farthest distance in both the cases)


* Core Idea :
  --------
   -> Large Intra Cluster distance
      Small Inter Cluster distance
