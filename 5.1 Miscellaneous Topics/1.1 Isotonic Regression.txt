-----------

=> If you have more parameter to estimate then you need more data or points

* Isotonic Regression
-------------
 -> most popular Calibration technique

 - works even when data plot is alike step-wise curve 
   or when plot doesnt looks like sigmoidal func

 Core Concept :- break original curve into multiple linear model

 Piece-Wise Linear Model 
 _________________
 - so Isotonic Calibration :- tries to approximate the func using the bunch of linear models
   & this is known as piece-wise linear model

 Q How to determine the piece ??
    - i.e lines & thresolds

 - just as min lines as possible

 Optimization Problem :- tries to find thresold & slopes & intercept of individual lines
                         (constraint : there should not be too many lines)

  thus in isotonic we need to find many parameter as compare to sigmoidal (ie platt scaling)
     - thresolds {a1, a2, a3...}
       slopes & intercept {(m1,b1), (m2,b2),...}

       whereas in platt Scaling :- A & B only

  -> If you have more parameter to estimate then you need more data or points

     As more param so -> more D_calibration points -> more D_CV -> more data pts -> very large dataset

     Thus at the end we need large dataset 

* Isotonic & Sigmoidal :
   
   when dataset is large :- can use Isotonic Regression
                   small :- go for Platt Scaling
