* Productionizatio of Models


-----------

* Model Persistence :- pickling via joblib & Custom-Implementation

* High ThroughPut & Low-Latency

-------

=> Productionizing Model (realtime) happens at Large Scale
    \
     with high-throughput & low-latency requirements

=> Productionizing Model requires several skills such as :-
    1) software Eng        (C/C++ advantage as Low level access)
    2) Data Structure      (Hash Table)
    3) Distributed Systems (Load balancer)

* Productionizing Models
   \
    -> At Large Scale

- You train your model on your system
  but then in realtime, to engage with realtime data you productionize your model on some other
  powerful system


* Model Persistence :
  ----------
   -> You train your model, then after some time
      If you want to use again that model then would you train again new model ??
       -> No

      Instead store your classifier/regressor any model to your disk

      & Load that from disk when you required again

      This process of storing computed model to disk & loading it when needed is known as Model Persistence

   You can store model as a string inside file (ie text file)
    or
   You can pickel your model i.e serializng & deserializig in python using pickle module

   -> Better option (for pickling) is using sklearn library

1) one way to productionize the Model Persistence using Sklearn Stuff
   
   Sklearn
   -------

=> sklearn.externals.joblib   <-** simple API for pickling models

* Pikle file :- extension `fName.pkl`

=> So Model Persistence is unique method to persist your model using sklearn stuff to store model
   in disk & reuse whenever required.

- sklearn is implemented in python so it may be slower for low-latency application

-> Thus via this way we can store model in disk & bring it to RAM when required !

2) Custom Implementation :
   --------------------
   -> Store all params of model to file
   
   - esp for low-latency application

   -> We can implement customly in diff languages such as C/C++/Java
      So we can implement models in C/C++/Java


Aspects of Productionization :
--------

* In case of Linear Models : Store Weights in Hash Table 
  \
   Why in hash table ? -> because Most the time It gonna be Sparse Vector

* In case of DT :- leverage Low Level language such as C/C++ & write if-else condition in that

* High ThroughPut :
  ------------
   - Lots of query point in less time

     (In real time there is Load Balancer which distribute the queries to distributed system
       ie to different CPU ) 

* Comp Org :
  ---

  - Lot of things you need frequently you put in Cache than Ram

    Whenever there is something you wanna reuse a lot, then you can consider that to store in Cache
    (You can do via any lang ie C/C++/Java/Python, to store smthng in cache forcefully)

    Because - Basic Computer Organization Concepts

       -> Cache lies on same chip as of CPU so its closest & CPU can reach it quickly

       -> RAM lies on diff chip, so CPU need to communicate with RAM via MotherBoard & wires

       -> Hard Disk is far comparatively of above 2
