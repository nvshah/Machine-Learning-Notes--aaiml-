------

-> We say that 2 lines L1 & L2 are almost similar if :-
     - both are almost overlapping
     - cosine dist between them is less
________

Basic Idea :- Try removing outliers step by step from training data before finalizing the model
              in further piepline (ie for Cross Validation)

* RANSAC ( Random Sampling Consensus )
 ------

  - Consider Linear Regression & if there are extreme outliers on 1 side then those may pull the 
    decision surface (ie seperating line) towards them

  So modeling in such scenario of extreme outlier is possible using RANSAC

 RANSAC idea :- 

  - Instead of training on all pts take random sample from Training Data
    then your model will be less impacted by an outliers comparatively

  Steps :-

   1) Take some random samples from the Entire D-train data

   2) Train the model on random sample i.e L0  // linear reg model 0
      - remove the outliers identify by this model from original D_Train
                    \
                     -> large yi - yi` for this model (random sample data)

   3) After removal of outliers found in L0, treat the new D_train_1

   - Repeat the steps 1, 2, 3 till you get L_i almost same as L_i+1 (ie till you Converge)

   Note : L_i & L_i+1 almost same means :- almost overlapping or cosine distance is less between them

   At the end of this your model will be Robust
