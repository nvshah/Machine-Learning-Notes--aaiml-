------

=> For large amt of data its preferable to perform - AAB testing
___________

- Google earns billion & trillions just by showing Ads in their search result

=> When you do not have same same data pt for 2 different model
   then connsider Confidencee Interval instead of point Estimate for Metric
----

gist :- (AB testing)
 
  -> break the data into 2 groups & apply old model on 1 grp & new model on another grp
     &
     whilst doing comparision, instead if doing ratio|point estimate go for probabilistic|CI

     
* A/B testing
 ---------
  - Bucket Testing | Split Run | Controlled Experiments

  - A/B testing is used in  Science & esp in Medical Field

  Eg Drug :
     ----
      Consider some drug D1 for cold already present
      If some company introduce new drug D2 for cold then A|B testing can be useful

      Test D1 for half of sample & D2 for another half for recovery time


* AB & ML :
 -------
  - Eg Google Search Enngine & Which Ads to show on which search

- Offline testing
- Online Testing : Testing in real world (production data)

* CTR (Click Through Rate) :
  ---
   # clicks / # ads shown

   - Its a metric to compare model for search Engine & Ads 
      (ie Model which help to display ads for users)

  Often for new model -> start with 90 - 10 split // 90 for old model & 10 for new

Q) How to compare CTR between 2 models (old & new) ?? 
   [as data are imbalanced between both]

   -> Use Confidence Interval innstead of Point estimate

   => Never conclude the comparision just based on Point Estimate of CTR, 
      esp when data is imbalanced for verification
      Also account the Confidence Interval

    See if CI of both are overlapping 
      \
       if its overlapping then we can't draw out any particular thing

   =? To really sure if ModelB is better than ModelA, then their CI should not overlap or 
      if overlap then overlapping should be minimal as possible


* A|A testing :
  __________
  split the population in parts & apply same old model to both randomly seperated group


* A-A-B testing :
  ____________
   Split your Universe in 3 parts instead of 2 ie A, A, B

   A - old
   B - new 

   This will help us to check if New Model is really good performant or 
   its just randomness of splitting which is giving advantage to new model sometime.

   => AAB test are preferable for large amoutn of data
