* Data Science Life Cycle
 ----------

 1) Data Acquisition:

     ETL (Extract Transform Load)
       SQL for this purpose
       Data in {database, data-warehouse, log files, Hadoop/Spark, Flat Files }

 2) Data Preparation

     Cleaning, Pre-Processing

 3) EDA (Exploratory Data analysis)

     Plots, Vix, Hypothesis Testing, Slice & Dice Data

 4) Modeling, Evaluation & Interpretation  <- First Cut Model

     Performance Matrix

 5) Communicate Results :

     Clear & Simple in Naive manner

 6) Deployment : Engineering

 7) Real World Testing : A|B testing
         \
          Compare with Current Production Model in Market

 8) Business/Customer Buy in :
      - convince them to buy in model soln
      - Business Impact

 9) Operations :

     Retrain Models, Handle Failures, Process


 10) Optimization 

     (After 1st Cut Solution)
     improve models, design more features, etc...
