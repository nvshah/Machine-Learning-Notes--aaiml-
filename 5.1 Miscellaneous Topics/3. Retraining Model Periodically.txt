3. Retraining Model Periodically

- Consider Stock Market Prices Prediction Data

  So you train your model & predict for upcoming days is your basic aim

  Now let say it works good for next 3 days but on 4th day it did not perform well
  - that is the signal that you should traing your model again on that 4th day with most reent data
    & utilise new trained model for onwards predictions (ie 5th day, ...)

Q) How to spot when to Re-train ?
  
  -> If cost of retraining is not much high (ie its trivial), then you can retrain on some interval basis

  Otherwise you can consider several factors

   - Model Performance is dropping

   - dataset itself is changing (Non-Stationary Data)

      Eg Stock Market Prices :- there are several factors impacting it
                                such as dollar drop, Rupees rise, gold price drop, etc...

     Check if test & train data have same or diff distb
