Tips :-

 -> Visualization can neve be perfect 

 RuleOfThumb -
     :- the far the distributions are (i.e seperated) the better
     :- the closer the distributions are, More overlap more confusion & not much better

=> Just 1 Outlier can corrupt whole Mean/Variance number
   As long as less than 50% points are corrupted, Median remains sensible unlike Mean.

=> 50th percentile = Median
   Percentile gives you idea about population proportion lying on either side relatively

=> 1D-Density = PDF
   2D-Density = Contour Plots

______________________

* EDA
  ----
   -> We usually do before building our model

=> Do data analysis inline with the core Objective

  DataPoints - row
  Features - 
=> Think of each dimension as a feature

* Balanced Data Set
  Imbalanced DataSet : # of data-points per each class(labels) are not balanced (i.e 50:950)

* In 3-D space we can draw a Plane instead of Line

* We humans can visualize 3D (need hack for 4D, 5D, ...)

* Pair Plot :
  --------
   -> Hack to visualize higher dimension
   -> Matrix of diff plots of diff combinations of features (i.e nC2)
   -> Mirror images on either side of diagonals (i.e x axis becomes y and y axis becomes x)

   plus : Pair Plot is good when dimensionality is less (i.e < 6)

   minus : If dimension (i.e feature) increases. Why ?? -> (nC2) combination formula also increases


!Q) Problem with 1-D Scatter Plot :
    ----------
   -> Crowded in some region so can't get exact idea about count
      So we can use Histogram to get much more details (i.e counts better)


* Histogram : (PDF)
  --------
   -> Idea is to divide that Crowded interval into smaller buckets(windows) 
    - Visualize Density

      X-Axis : values
      Y-Axis : Counts(Freq)

   -> Probability Density Function : (PDF)  | DENSITY PLOT
      -----
       - Smooth form of jagged Lines in Histogram
       - Smoothed Histogram  (KDE)

    Overlap :
   { Thresold : S.T minimal error }

* Univariate Analysis :
  -------
   - 1 variable analysis
      \
       -> which varaible is more useful among others ??
          If you need to pick 1 feature ??

   RuleOfThumb ->
     the far the distributions are (i.e seperated) the better
     More overlap more confusion & not much better


* CDF :
  ---
   { starts from 0 -> 1 }
   -> What percentage is below x (i.e it gives & resembles somewhat to percentiles)

   -> Cumulative Sum or
      heights of all probabilities come before that (including x's as well) in PDF

   -> CDF is AUC of PDF uptil given point x

    CDF - PDF relation :-
    --------
    When you differentiate CDF -> PDF
    When you Integrate PDF -> CDF

   => CDF helps you to find thresold(i.e overlapping thresold) more accurately (than PDF)
      with info such as 
        - how much retention is preserved
        - how much loss may happen
  ---

* Mean :
  ----
   (simple average) => measures central tendency 

   Outlier affects mean heavily
     - 1 simple error could corrupt my mine a lot

  Variance :
  ----
   Spread
   Standard Deviation = Sqrt(Variance)

   If S.D is small then spread is small

 => Thus Mean, Variance & S.D are easily corrupted by Outliers

 !Q) So are there any alternative to this ??
  ---
  ----

* Median:
  ----
   # sorted array # middle index

   Intutively very similar to Mean (alike)  [Alternative when problem faced by Outliers to Mean]
     \
      with few outliers it's similar to w.o. those outliers.

   Steps -> 1) Sort the numbers
            2) Pick the middle numbers

   NOTE -> 
     If more than 50% of points are corrupted then median gets corrupted
     As long as less than 50% points are corrupted, Median remains sensible unlike Mean.

* Percentile & Quartile :
  ----
   Percentile : 
      What % are beyound this val & What % are after this val.
      nth percentile = arr[n]

      50th percentile = Median

   Quantile :
     { 25, 50, 75, 100 }  -> percentiles = Quantile  (0, 25, 50, 75)

   => Percentile gives you idea about population proportion lying on either side relatively

   Q) Why emphasis 99 and 95 percentile imp ??
   -> Consider Amazon(ecomm) example

Q) What is Stdandard Deviation = Avg distance/deviation from mean

* Median Absoulute Deviation :
  ----
   -> intuitvely doing same thing as Standard Deviation (i.e how far away from central tendency)

---
NOTE
---
  median == mean (idea)
  MAD    == SD   (idea)


* Inter Quartile Range (IQR)
  ----
   -> range in between 25th & 75th percentile i.e (50% of data lies in this range) 
      i.e between 2nd quantile & 4th quantile

   -> Sometimes used as approximation to S.D

* Box Plot :
  ---
   -> uses percentile | take ideas of Mean, Median, Percentile & put it into Box Form
   Eg - boxes corresponding to each of classes

   => You can use Box Plot to find Crowded Area Density idea for each class

   { Box + Whiskers }
     Box = IQR  
     Whiskers = Rest  (min and max val, 1.5 * IQR)
   
   - IQR is width of BOX
   - There is no standard way of drawing Whiskers
   - Most of your points fall within your whiskers

* Violin Plots :
  ----
   -> Histograms (PDF) + Box-Plots
   => Plots the histograms (probability density function) on the sides

* Univariate, Bi-Variate, Multi-Variate Analysis :
  ----
   Uni : 1 variable at a time, during analysis {eg PDF(histo), CDF, Box-Plot, Violin-Plot}
   Bi  : 2 variable                            {eg Scatter-Plot, Pair-Plot}
   Multi : multiple variable                   

* Multi-Dimension Density Function Plot | Countour Plot:
  -----
  Contour Density Plot :
    - used to interpret 2D distribution
    - Contours = diff color from inner to outer circles boundary  (darker to lower)
            
   -> Eg 2D Density Plot
         \
          Imagine Hill Coming Out (darker = higher, lighter = lower)
          Hill height higher - more point in 2D surface
          Hill height lower - fewer point in 2D surface

    - As we move away from center crowd decreases   (Eg Gaussian 2D Density Plot)

    -> Contour plots are used often by Civil Engineer, Geologist

   Countour Circles : all points have same height 
                      (grp pf points having same density)

   => Contour Plot helps you to find out higher density in 2D
