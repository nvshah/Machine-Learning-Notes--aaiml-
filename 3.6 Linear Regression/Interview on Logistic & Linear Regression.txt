2. After analyzing the model, your manager has informed us that your regression model is suffering from multicollinearity. How would you check if heâ€™s true? Without losing any information, can you still build a better model?(https://google-interview-hacks.blogspot.in/2017/04/after-analyzing-model-your-manager-has.html)
