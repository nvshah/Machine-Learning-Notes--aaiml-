* Error Distb :
  ---------
   -> Idea distb of an error would be straight line along 0

   -> more approximate would be thinner peak around 0

   -> As fatiness increases around 0, Idealness reduces 
       \
        Falling more slowly  - not good and we need to reduce some weights from weight vector
        Falling Quickly    - good
