GANs gist

* GANs :
  ---
   Generative Adverserail Network

   - 2 Models Majorly  (Generator & Descriminator)
   - Alternative Training for Models (either of 2 at a time)
   - Deep NN is used in both the Network

- Understand the GAN from 1st Principle
- All in all, GANs Training is not all about BackProp Algo only
  It's more about alternating Model Training
    - ie Train Generator, keeping Descrimantor Fixed
    - &  Train Descriminator, Keeping Generator Fixed
    - & Move Back & Forth between this 2 in same way


Q) Why alternating Minimization in GANs better than Optimizing both the Model/network together ??

 -> because both the models used Deep NN &
    to update lots of weights at both side at same time is quite bit complex & strenous process
    So
    to match this & deal with this Alternatin gOptimization Mechanism is used/adopted

 -> To know in detail :- Learn Game-Theory, Min-Max Theorem
