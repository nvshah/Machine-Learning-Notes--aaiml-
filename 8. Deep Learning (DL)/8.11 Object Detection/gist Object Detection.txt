-> Standard Dataset used in Object Detection :- COCO dataset

   Standard Dataset used for Images :- ImageNet

-< Ideas :- BatchNorm, Stride Conv, No Pooling, Pre-Trained Model

Steps Involves :-

1. Feature Extractor (via Striding & DownScaling)
   - DarkNet-53
2. Object Box Bounded Encoding/Vector
   - find possible Boxes around a cell (as a center)


=> You do Bounding Box things (ie Encoding tensor) on Grid obtained after downsampling via Feature Extractor

=> You have Bounding Box for each of the cells
    |
    - So We are operating in the space of cells & not in the space of Pixels
    - Also this Bounding BOx things we are not doing for entire image but for cells of that image
      (otherwise it would be slow if done for entire image & image is extremely large)

Hyperparameter :- #Boxes

How it Works (Gist)

- Let say you have some images
  \
   Training :-
   - then you will scale down those images first (via Striding, DownSampling)
   - You'll convert to Bounding Box Representation ( from cell)
   - Then you will calculate the Loss

  -> So when you downsample your Image, You're getting closer to the Possible Objects in the Image

* YOLO V3

  major things happening :
  1. DarkNet-53,             // kinda preprocessing (feature extractor)
  2. MultiScale-Prediction  // For multiple grid sizes
  3. FPN   //

=> Each Convo used is followed by Batch Normalization & again Followed by Leakr Relu's

-> Use Filtering & NMS, otherwise number of Boxes you have will be enormously large
