* Object Detection Notes
----------------------

-----------

- Face Detection is diff from Obj Detection

Dataset :- COCO

-----------

* Objective :-
  ---
  - Bounding Boxes Draw/Derive in Image
  - There could be multiple obj of same type in single img

- In Img Segmentation : Pixel Level // care more abt pixels
  In Obj Detection :- We care more about bounding box


* Performance Metric :
  ---
  - How do we measure our detection is good ?

  - Ground Truth &   // Actual
    Prediction       // Predicted


* IOU :-
  ---
  -> Intersection over Union
     := Area of Overlap / Area of Union

  - Ideal Case :- Exact Overlapi (thus IOU = 1)  // The best case
    Worst Case :- IOU = 0

  - Ideal Thresold is IOU := 0.5
    |
    Overlap 50 or more % with Ground Truth Rectangle

-> Now we will translate identifying this Bounded Rectangle as a Classic Binary Classification Problem

   In image there will be multiple objects So there it's no more binary classif but multiple binary classif
   Eg
    - Chair, Person, ...

* Precision-Recall Curve : (Metric)
  ---
  -> used for Metric
  -> Area under Precision Recall Curve   (Just same as AUC-ROC curve)

  -> Au-PRCurve
  -> Best case := 1

  -> This AU-PRCurve we observe by picking any 1 class (ie let say Chair)
     &
     then by changing thresold, we can get diff predictions & for each of them we can get Precision & Recall
     & We can plot Avg Precision Curve


* Mean-Avg-Precision (MAP)
  ---
  - Avg Precision for all classess (seperately)
    &
    then take mean of all of them


-----------

* DL Models :

  inp :- img/video
  out :- bounding box, obj class  // corresponding

* TradeOff :-
  - Speed vs MAP

* Algorithms :
  --------
  - R-CNN (Regional CNN)
    Fast CNN
    Faster CNN

    FPN-FRCN

    -> these are good for MAP  (than speed)

  - RetinaNet

  - YOLO V1
         V2  // Can compare 9000 objects
         V3

    ( YOLO has 3 versions based on different Image Size)
    Image Size determines how large or how small objects you want to determine.

=> We want Lower time & Higher MAP

REMEMBER :- If my input img is bigger, then detecting smaller object is easier compare to
            when my Inp image is smaller (as there are not many small pixels)

=> Selecting whcih version of YOLO depends on how small object you need
