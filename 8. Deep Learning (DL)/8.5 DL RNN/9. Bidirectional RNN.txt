9. Bidirectional RNN
-------------------

--------
TIP

-> Whenever you need to understand Forward Prop & backward Prop, just use or consider direction of arrrows

---------
REM

-> BRNN is very popular in NLP & Speech domain

---------

* Notion :-

-> What if my Output at time t is dependent on inp at time t+1


* Uni-Directional RNN :- Regular RNN you've is uni-directional RNN
  ---
   - Sequence is being processed from first word to last word

* Bi-Direction Idea : (BRNN)
  ---
  - In addition to forward connection, for every neuron we also have a backward connection

  - 2 directions (ie 2 type of connections)

  - Lot of information in Later inps that can impact/affect your previous outputs

  - Forward Impacts
    Reverse Impacts (later units impacting output)

  - Impacting from earlier or later units
    &
    Vice-Versa :- ie Impacting on prev output from later units (ie Reverse Direction)

  - very popular in NLP tasks

  - can also be used in Speech
     (here you need to let all the audio recording done before you use the bidirectional RNN)

     So in audio, if you want spontaneous conversion (ie as I speak I get output) then Bidirectional RNN is
     not useful much

     But instead if you first speak the sentence & then if you want to translate tha audio into text via BRNN
     then its possible

  -> Structure useful when this matters :-
       - " What you say afterwards also impacts previous things "
