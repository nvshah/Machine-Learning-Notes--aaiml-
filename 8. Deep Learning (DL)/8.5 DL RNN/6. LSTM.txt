Terms

- Cell State
- Identity Flow
- Forget Gate



-------------

- In simple RNN, we do add weights & corresp inp (ie curr + prev)
  Now
  In case of LSTM, instead of adding we will have merge operation


* Simple RNN :- Ot = f(W*X_t + W`*O_t-1)
                Yi` = g(W``*Ot)

  LSTM : (Notion)
  ---

  Merge :- Concat the
               O_t-1 & X_it  // Inp Vectors
               W & W`   // Matrices corresp

           Then you just Do Dot Product of those large Matrices obtained after Concatenating them up

  Terminology

  Cell := Activation Unit

  C_t := Cell State

  When 2 arrow line join :- it means concatenation

  Point-Wise Operation :- Element Wise Operation


* LSTM :
  ----
   - involves the concatenation part

   LSTM-Cell

 - tanh point-wise operation vs tanh-neuron layer :
   -----
    -> tanh point-wise := applying tanh() to each elem of vector elem-wise
    -> tanh neuron-layer := network of tanh() (ie as activation unit) neurons

 - Cell State comes from prev timestamp & flows to next timestamp


(1) LSTM (Top Layer Explaination)
------------------------------

-> By Top layer it means comprises of :- Forget gate & Curr gate
   Forget gate :- handles how much info to flow from previous stage to next stage
   Curr gate :- handles how much info to flow from curr stage to next stage

* LSTM & ResNets :-
* Identity Cell State Flow :
  ---
   - If your (*) inp is [1,1,1,1,1,...]
             (+) inp is [0,0,0,0,0,...]

   - Then you can see your cell state flow as it is from time (t-1) to time (t+1)

   - This concept is similar/analogous to Residual Block in ResNet

   [Analogous]
   - Thus we can see lot more similarity between "ResNets" & "LSTM" in terms what they want to achieve
     |
     In LSTM you have point-wise product & point-wise addition


-> Thus state of LSTM can be carried as if we want
-> we can decide how much of my prev-state I want to keep in my next state

-> Forget Gate :
   ---
    Tell us how much % of prev-state info must retained for next stage

    - It is (*) operation in LSTM unit

   NewInfo gate :
   ---
    How much of new info should I consider to add from current time to flow it to next stage

    - It is (+) operation in LSTM unit

=> Mimp thing is you can skip over connection


(2) LSTM (Internal Layer Explaination)
--------------------------------

    2.1) :-
    Forget Gate
    ---
    - This stage structure tells us how much to remember or forget from prev-state to next-state
    Forget Gate Weights :- Wf := weight you concatenate from h_t-1 & x_t

    Forget Val F_t := how much of prev-val you must forget whislt proceeding to ahead
       \
        How much you forget or retain from prev-cell-state to next cell-state

    2.2) :-
    Input gate :
    ---
    - A Structure
    - This structure tells us how much to add to previous state (whilst it flow to next part)


    2.3)
    Output gate (Structure):
    ----
    -> your output depends on prev-output, curr-state, prev-cell-state

       // NOTE :- prev cell state is already modified by Forget Gate & Input Gate Struture (before it arrives Output Gate Structure)

    -> tanh poit-wise func is used

    -> determines how your cur-output is generated based on prev-cell state & curr-cell-state inputs

=> Thus output from LSTM unit will be :-
   - cell state (c_t) & output of that cell (h_t)


* FIO structure & LSTM :
  ---
   Forget, Input, Output


* Long-Term Dependency & LSTM
  -----------------------
  - because we have a way to short-circuit the LSTM unit & pass prev-state to next state as it is
    we can hold up on to long-term dependency

  - via LSTM we have a way to worked out a long-term dependency (via Short-Circuit )
  - Because of possibility of Short-Circuit connection via LSTM unit, we can impact the output
    even which is very far away



-----------
[My Gist]

- In my terms LSTM helps to manage the long-term dependency between Inp & Output part of Sequences
  via
  Allowing to propogate the cell state to next stage readily,
  thus avoiding useless interaction inbetween for true real connection/dependency
