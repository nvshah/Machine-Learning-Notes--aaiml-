* RNN :
  ----

  Core Structure:
  --
   - It's not diff layer connected in MLP fashion
   - But it's one layer repeated over time

   - So instead of lots of layer its single layer repeated many times

* Recurrent unit :
  ---
   - The layer which we discussed above is often called as Recurrent Unit in RNN

=> Don't forget that there are 3 Weights imp in RNN

=> Long-term dependency won't work well with Simple RNN
