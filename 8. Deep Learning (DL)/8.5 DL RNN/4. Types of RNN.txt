Types of RNN

1) Many to One :
  ---
   - useful for sentiment classif

2) One to Many :
  ---
   - no seq in inp
   - Input is just 1 Point & in output you may have many (ie Sequence)

   - Eg Image Captioning :
          \
           Image -> What is in the Image
                     |
                     Sentence about Image

3) Many to Many : (Same Length)
  ---
   - inp & out both are sequence
   - same length for inp <-> out
   Application
    - part of Speech

   - often used in NLP

   - here seq are generated parallely

4) Many to Many : (diff Length)
  ---
   - Inp & Out can be of diff sizes
   - Eg Machine Translation
   -    English to Spanish Sentence Translation

   - It's also called as an Encoder-Decoder Network
   - It is often known as Seq-to-Seq models.

   - Here first input is processed & then output is generated (ie Linear fashion)
       \
        Intution : without seeing whole English Sent I may not translate it into spanish
                   (as gramatical structure for Eng is diff from that of spanish)

        - thus all inputs are followed by all the outputs in this case

5) One to One :
  ----
   - It's nothing but a simple MLP
   - (ie no recurrent part but single recurrent component to say it)

[REMEMBER]
=> Don't forget that there are 3 Weights
   W1 :- Takes input for current action
   W2 :- goes with ouput of prev action
   W3 :- third weight generating Yi's
