- Simplified Transformer
- Simple Concept


- BERT is inspired from concept of Transformer
  BERT is a type of Transformer which is simple & equally powerful & can be useful for wide span of tasks

- You can think a BERT of as a Sentence Encoding Model which you can use it in wide span of NLP task
  such as Sentence Analysis, Sentiment Analysis, Text Classification, Question Answering Systems

-> You can think BERT as a better version of Word2Vec

* Application :
  - Question Answering Systems
  - NLP (modern mostly uses BERT)

-> BERT was first model that beats human or perform well for "Question Answering" Task

* Objective :
  --
  - Given Sentence can I get Vector

  For Images we do have such kinda facility :- VGG16, ResNet
  For NLP we have now this :- BERT


* Archi :
  -----
  - Encoder Only Model
  - Bert_base, Bert_large

  - Only Encoders-Stack
    These Encoders are also called as a "Transformer Block"

  - By Encoder it means all it comprises of :-
    { Positional Encoding,  Self-Attention, Normalization, Feed Forward, Skips (Residual) }


* Inp-Out :
  ----
  - First word :- class
  - For every word every encoder generates an output corresp to inp

  NOTE :- based on the #units in Feed-Forward NN, the output vector for each corresp word in Encoder will
          be decided

=> Given a trained BERT model you can use it for simple text-classification task !

=> Bert is Bi-directional Model :

* Bi-Directional Model :
  ---
   - better than forward only models
   - looking at word before & after matters


Q) Word2Vec :
    -> You try to predict word in context to surrounding words using Simple Feed Forward NN
    -> In case of Word2Vec we have simple Feed Forward NN

* Masked Language Model : (Training Bert)
  -------
  - Similar to Word2Vec concept
    Instead of using Feed Forward Layer in Word2Vec,
    Here in case of BERT we are using Encoder based Model with lots of layers of encoding (ie Transformer layer )

  - Randomly mask some words in inp (to Bert)

  - In BERT we will have Encoder based Transformer Model (instead of Feed Forward Model)
    |
    which is far more powerful than Feed Forward Model (of word2vec )

  - So in masked language model :
  -> some words are masked in input & we need to predict what this word should be (given the other words)
     Thus Predict the masked words

  -> Then we can use Back Propogation to improve model

  -> We randomly choose the word as to be masked
     &
     then expect the model to learn & predict that masked word correctly

  -> So via Masked Language Model, you train your BERT model


---------

* Train Bert on 2 Sentence
  ----------------
  - What if you need to input 2 Sentences ?? (ie Eg SentB comes after SentA)

  -> Use Seperator & just train BERT on it
      |
      You need to consider output corresp to [CLS] only &
      just build a simple model (eg Classifier using Feed Forward)


* Bert Feature Extraction :
  ------------------
  - after each encoder layer you will get some vec representation for each word
