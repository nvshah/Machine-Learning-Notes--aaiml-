ref : attention all you needs


-------------
-> There is more similarity between Word2Vec and Transformer

--------------

1. Transformers
----------------
- Attention is core of Transformer

- Transformer is a Seq to Seq Model

- It has total 6 Encoders

(let)
* Objective : Transform French -> English
  So you have data :- LIST[(Eng_txt, french_txt)]

- Transformer possess bunch of Encoder & bunch of Decoder
-> Encoder-Decoder in case of Transformer are based on concept of Attention &
   does not use concept of RNN

-> #encoders & #decoders must be same

- Stack of Encoders & Decoders

* Encoder Structure
  ----
   Possess 2 main things
   1. Feed Forward NN
      - 512 Hidden layers
   2. Self Attention Layer

   -> All the words in sent are converted to vector (let say by Word2Vec)
   -> All the words are feeded to Attention layer simultaneously

   - Self Attention convert word's vector x1 -> z1 & likewise for all words
   - Feed Forward convert z1 -> r1
     &
     r1 (out) is the output of Encoder Block for word x1 (inp)

     For every word we have xi & corresp out ri


* Self-Attention Module :
  ----
   - self attention means where I am focusing in the sentence among words for current words

   - Trainable Matrices param of Self attention module

   - z1 is generated from x1 by self attention

----
REMEMBER :
 In your normal MultiLayer Feed Forward networkr also when you have more than 1 activation unit in 1 layer
 then your all inputs will be alike vector & output will also be a vector
 now in between your inputs gets applied over all units in layer & thus this interaction can be thought
 of as a Matric Multiplication

=> Thus Feed Forward NN involves lot of Matrix Multiplication
-----
  STEPS
   - Embeddings
     Queries   // 64 dimen vectors | dk
     Keys     // 64 diemn vecor
     Values   // 6 dimen

     Divide by 8 // Why ?? -> So that Gradient become more stable
     SoftMax   // will get us relative proportion & also sum of all eq=1

     Softmax * Value
     Sum

  Step 1 :- Trainable Matrices (W_Q, W_V, W_K)

  These whole things (all steps) can be written using Matrix

Significance :
---
 -> Attention helps us to focus on some of words in vicinity which matters

* Multi-Headed Attention :
----------
- Increase the complexity of Self Attention Computation
- Instead of only 1 pair of matrices (ie Q, K, V), we will have multiple pair of Matrices

-> The single-headed Attention Model only focus on some set of words

-> So when you just not need to focus only 1 set of words but different set of words
   (in same sentence)
   then you can consider Multi-headed Attention Model

-> Increase Representational Power
-> Encode more words & thus more hyper-parameters (ie more matrices to train)

   So it would be like:
    - 1 pair of matrices (ie head) will focus on some set of words (from sentence)
      whereas other pair (ie other head) will focus on some other set of words

   & this way we can have diverse context of vicinity of particular words in same sentence

   8-headed Attention Model :-
    -> You need to combine|concat 8 Matrices so that you can get 1 output
    -> Then you multiply the resulted matrix with W0
    - thus at the end you will have 1 matrix as output (which will be feeded to next attention in a layer)

=> So all in all there are bunch of Matrices as a Hyper-Parameter

-> The model learns the weights via BackPropogation for given dataset


* Positional Encoding :
  ------------------
  -> In RNN timestamp tells you which word come before which one
     but here we do not have any such thing
     So
     We use Positional Encoding to encode word vectors before they are feeded to Encoder

  -> The resultant vector encapsulate the info (ie which word is where in relation to next word)
  - So the vectors are design in such a way that :-
     it encapsulate the relative positioning
     & also the distance between the words

  - So via Positional Encoding you can decide that which word come before which word in Transformers

* Layer Wise Normalization :
  ----
  - normalize the output of Self-Attention layer
  - There is Add & Normalize Layer (step) after each layer (ie Self-Attention, Feed Forward NN)

* Residual Connection :
  ---
  - let say if some Self-Attention layer is useless then we can skip those via Residual Connection
  - ShortCut type of Residual Connection


* Decoder Part :
  ----
  - In Decoder model, it's almoste similar to Encoder except
    there is 1 more Self-Attention Layer in between (ie its called as Encoder-Decoder Attention)

  - Encoder-Decoder Attention :- Extra Attention layer (in mid)
     \
      The vector from encoder (that comprised info or representation of entire text)
      is passed to this (ie Encoder-Decoder Attention layer) portion of Decoder


[IMP]
* Encoder Decoder - Transformer (Working)
  ----
  - At a time -> You take all the words (ie entire sentence ) & generate the 1 Word as a output
     |
     -> All the word are encoded at the same time

  - Thus My Encoder take the whole inputs &
    My Decoder consider the Previous Outputs (generated in prev time)

  - Decoder is already taking the info about cur-time from the Encoder via a vector
    (ie Encoded Vector to Encoder-Decoder Attention layer)

    So Encoder do not need to run many times as Encoder consider all inp (ie words of sent)
    run it & produce output vector
    which it gives to Decoder (at Encoder-Decoder Attention part)

    So Encoder run through the whole sentence once & provide output to Decoder
    &

    Now it's Decoder which will run multiple times at different timestamps
    Considering vector recived from Encoder & previous output generated by itself

  - Encoder/Encdoing is 1 time thing
    Decoder/Decoding is time based step by step thing

  => All input is ingested once
     Output is generated step-by-step (ie acoording timesteps)


* Takeaways (Transformer)
  ----
  -> faster than RNN-based models as all input is ingested once

  -> Whole idea is alike CNN (ie neighborhood like concept)
     In CNN, (For Convolution, you look around for pixel in vicinity)

     Similarly here in case of Transformer, concept is same as with neighborhood
     (We let model to learn ie which word to focus on for current word)

* Application :
  ---
  - Text Summarization
  - For wide range of NLP task
