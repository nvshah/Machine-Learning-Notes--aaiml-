TF_Keras_1
------------

---
lib useful :
- h5py, tf, keras

---

- Preprocess Images (0-1)
-> 'Adam' is one of the best optimizer

gist :
1. Load Data
2. Pre Process
3. Prepare N/W
4. Compile & Run  (Tensorboard)

terms

-> epoch, performance
-> checkpointing
-> Functional API vs Sequential API  // Keras

---


* from_logits <- Param
  ---
   \
    Do convert to probability after final output-layer

   - When outputs are not necessarily probability values !


* tensorboard :
  ---
   - useful to check what is happending in my model (ie to debug things)
   - When model is getting trained, it writes to a log file at each epoch
   - tensorboard reads from logfile
     &
     Model writes to a logfile

   - Model -> logdir (log file) <- Tensorboard

   - `callbacks` :- param that handles writing of info to log file whilst model is getting trained


* CheckPointing :
  ---
   - Save Model at end of each epoch

   - We can use checkpoint file to save Weights (let say after 20 epochs), so that you can continue from
     it later
     NOTE : You need to remember the Model Archi. in this case

   - If we want to start from 21 epoch later then its possible via CheckPointing

   Tip := Store your checkpoint to Google Drive (so if colab die ie box die then we can take back)


* Functional API based model
  -------
   - functional API vs  Sequential API


* TensorFlow/Keras :- allows to add diff regularization at diff layers

=> Whenever you want to model even a slightly complex model,
   a Functional API is preferred over Sequential API

* Skip Connection & CNN :
  ------
   - Functional Connection helps to build the Skip Connection

* Global Avg Pooling :
