Notes

* Techniques (for Time Series Forecasting)

1. Moving Window Avg
2. Uni-Variate Time Series Forecasting
3. Multi-Variate & Single-Step Forecasting
4. Multi-Variate & Multi-Step Forecasting

Objective :- Weather Forecast Prediction

----

-> In time series forecasting genrating data is trickiest thing

-> Revolution of Models (Time Series)
   ARIMA -> LSTM -> Transformer -> BERT

----

1. MWA (Moving Window Avg)
   ---
   - mean


* Univariate LSTM :
  ---
  - At every timestamp we have only 1 variable value (ie temperature) to predict future temperature

  -> 1 LSTM cell can be represented as unwrapped over time


* MultiVariate :
  ----
  Preprocessing :- same steps (but here you normalize all the 3 features)

  1. Single Step
     -> Yi is Scalar

  2. Multi Step
     -> Yi is vector

  => It's not necessary to predict data right now, you can predict for future hours as well
      \
       thats denoted by future_target in code

  -> First Dimension is #TimerSeries
     Second Dimension is size of timeseries
     third dimension is What feature do you have at each time step

  -> Optimizing using RMSProp

  > MultiStep Output :
    - Time Series as Inp & Time Series as Output

    - complex archi : inp > LSTM(32) > LSTM(16) > Dense(72)

    - We will have output as 72 values


* Build more complex model
  ----
  - if performance is not at par

  - via adding more LSTM layers
    via increasing the number of epochs


* Observation
  ---
  - because we used more features & longer period (from history), predictions are improved
