2. Shapely Notes 2
------------------

=> Most problem in Algo that have Exponential T.C. are solved using Approximate Algortihms

------------

* Shapely Value :
  ---
   -> How much each feature contribute to final output
   => Can give you additive explanation about why output is deferring from original estimation
   -> You can connect Shapely values to the Conditional Expression

* Marginal Contribution
----------
- Difference in Output

* Expectations & Shapely Values :
  -------
  -> You can connect Shapely values we learn to the conditional Expectations


* Kernel Shap :
  ----
  -> LIME + Shapely Values
  -> Instead of computing feature imp from Linear Models we will compute it via Shaping Values for each featur
  -> FI via using math of Shapely values

  -> Kernel Shap used to define proximity func as well

* Tree Shap :
  -------
  -> generate shapely values for Tree based algo that approximates the values.
  -> Approximation Algo
  -> More Approximation

=> Kernel Shap is slower but Kernel Shap gives result that is more similar to Human-Intution
