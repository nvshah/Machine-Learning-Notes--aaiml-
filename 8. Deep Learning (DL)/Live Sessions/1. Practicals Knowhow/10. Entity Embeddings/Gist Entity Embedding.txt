Gist Entity Embedding

=> Generally Sparse Repr (Vector) such as TF-IDF, BOW, OHE are in large size
   &
   doesnt represent good semantically

=> Embedding are alike Dense Feature vectors

* Entity :
  ---
  -> Any object which can be included in ML/DL task
  Eg - Users, Products, Jobs, Job-Applicants, etc...

  Approaches :
  1. Sequence based Entity Embedding
  2. Supervised based Embedding Strategy
  3. Simultaneous Embeddings of Interacting Entities (MF based techniques)
  4. Simple Weighted Sum
  5. Auto Encoder

  RecSys (2 ways)
  -> Matrix Factorization (2 ways)
  -> Neural Collaborative Filter (ie Neural CF)


* Some New Topics :
  ---
  Neural Collaberative Filtering Archi

  Left-Right Combined Archi with Hadammard Product (ie Component Wise Product)


* New Technqiyes

  - Product2Vec      ( Seq Data)
  - MetaProduct2Vec  (Seq + MetaData)


-> Whenever there is LSTM, it is 1 inp at a time to model archi
