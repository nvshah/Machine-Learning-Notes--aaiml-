1. Session 1

* Graph Neural Networks & Geometric Learning :
----------

- BiPartite Graph

----------

* Graph-NN :
  -----
  Embeddings for {Vertex, Edge, Entire-Graph}

  Vertex :- Entity (Real World)
  Edges :- RelationShips

=> You can think a text as Line Graph

* Node-Level Task :
  ---
  Eg -> Image Segmentation
     -> Part of speech in Text

* 4 things Imp :
  ---
  - Node
  - Edges
  - global context
  - Connectivity    // via Adjacency Matrix

  Problem with Adjacency Matrix
  -> Space inefficient

  => In Image & Text there is some natural ordering
     But
     In Graph there is no such ordering
     Nodes do not have any natural ordering in general Graphs

* Problem in Representing as a Graph :
  ---
  - Adjacency Matrix for same graph may differ as per order of vertices

* Permutation Invariant :
  ---
  -> on changing the labelling of vertices, the Model/Graph Structure remains intact

* Graph-In, Graph-Out Archi :
  ------------
  For Images We have Conv layer
  For Text We have Self-Attention layer

  What layer we use for Graph-In Graph-Out Archi ??

* Pooling & Aggregation :
  ---
  - Pooling info from Edges to construct infor for Vertices

  Case 1 : Vertex Prediction

  Case 2 : Edge Prediction

* Graph Independent Layers :
  ---
  - Not using the Connectivity information (ie Adj. list)


* GNN :
  ---
  -> Use the Adj. List (ie Connectivity info) as well

  -> Graph Convolution layer
