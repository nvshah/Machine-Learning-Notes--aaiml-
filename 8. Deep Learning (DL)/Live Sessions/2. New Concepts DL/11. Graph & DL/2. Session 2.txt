2. Session 2

-> Vertex-Level task & Edge-Level Task

----------

-> Pooling information  between Universal, Vertex & Edge Representation

-> Universal Representation helps to pass info from Vertexes to Edges that are far away in Graph


* GNL :  (Graph Neural Layers)
  ----
  -> Layerwise-pooling, info is propogated lately for far-distance vertexes

  => As depth of network increases, some info is also going far away from nodes

* Type of Aggregation used :
  - Min, Max, Mean

* Message Passing  :
  - one of most imp Hyper-Param
  - for nodes, edges & globals
  - more info is passed across structure


* Sampling & Batching in GNN :
  -------------------------
  - diff vertextes have diff property of connection

  Techniqyes :
   1. Sample node sampling (1-degree neighbors)
   2. Random Walk Sampling  // Connected All Selected/Visited
   3. Random Walk with Neighborhood
   4. Difussion Sampling // (Gas Diffusion)

* Inductive Biases
  -----
  -> Prior info about the problem space that we are inducing into the model itself
     (as prior biases)

     Eg In Image (Convo) ;- Translation Invariant is implicitly induced

        In text :- Sequence Info (ie Order of Text's Words is Implicitly induced into the model)

        Self Attention is also one kinda Inductive Bias
         - For any word to understand it truly, we need to understand all the words (not just before that or after that only)

  => So lot of Deep Learning we learns have the inductive biases
     - CNN - via Translation Invariance & Convolution
       LSTM | Text Info - via Seq Information
       Transformer - via Self Attention Mechanism

  In Graph how to consider Inductive Biases ??!
  -> "Permutation Invariant"

  => Thus Graphs also have the inductive biases through Nodes, Edges, & Globals

* GCN as SubGraph Function Approximators :
  ---------
  Bag of k-graphs to obtains Subgraph Embeddings

  -> GCN is a fancy neural network on a Bag of K-Subgraphs

* Edges & Graph Dual :
  ----------------
  Dual :- Edges becomes vertices & vice-versa

  -> Helps to pose a vertex-level task to edge-level task
