Gist DL
-------

=> Earlier We do not have advantage of 
    - Lots of Data
    - Lots of Computational Power

* REMEMBER :
  
- Learning Rate (ie {Eta}) Val is generally smaller --!

- In Convolution Layer you have bunch of Weights & Kernels

-> regularization removes all useless Weights

=> initial layers in CNN often deal with the task of detecting the Borders, Common Shapes & Likewise
   (which is common among all tasks esp when we talk about Images)

=> Keep Small Learning Rates when you FineTune Your Model

-----
Basic Essential Concept

- Dropout, Batch Normalization
- RNN, CNN

-----

* Deep NN :
  ------
   -> You can consider Deep NN as below (my understanfing)
       \
        - Hidden Layers doing kinda Featurization tasks
        - Output layeer (ie Softmax | RELU) playing role of as a Predictor layer

* Batch Normalization :
  ---
   - A layer in NN, to avoid Internal Covariance Problem
   
[Batch Normalization Signnificance]
=> If you have Similar Distb among Diff Batch of Input, It will help you to 
   immprove your Grad|Derivative Term & thus help to Converge Faster
   &
   This is underhood idea of Batch Normalization


* Cross Entropy :
   -> Generalization of Log Loss for Multiple Classes in case of Deep NN


* Weight Layer can be possible in 2 ways :- Kernels or FC (ie fully connected layers)


* Regularization :
  ---
   - can be L1, L2, or Dropout
   -> regularization removes all useless Weights

* Data augmentation :
  ----
   - Is esp useful for Image Dataset
   - Rotate, Scale Shear, ...
   - To get more images correspondingly & thus helps to make robust CNN models


*) general CNN Convnet includes :
       - ConvLayer 
       - MaxPooling 
       - Flatten 
       - Dese layers 
       - DropOut

	ConvNet Part :- ConvLayer | MaxPoolinngg
	MLP Part :- Flatten | Dense layers | DropOut

	
*) RNN :
  ----
   - Recurrent Unit (Repeated multiple times)
   - 3 Weights to compute & deal with

   => Long-term dependency won't work well with Simple RNN

   -> Time axis plays an important role in case of RNN

*) BLUE Score :- specialized metric for transformation of sentences mesaurement
