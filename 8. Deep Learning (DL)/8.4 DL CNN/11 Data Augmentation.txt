11 Data Augmentation 
-------------------

------
REMEMBER

Data Augmentation is esp used for Image Dataset 
   \
    used mostly in CNN

-------------

- Data Augmentation helps to make CNN Models more robust towards rotation, scale, cropping, etc...
  by introducing the invariances onto the dataset

- Some of the operations that covered by augmentation is :-
  - flips, horizontal shift, vertical shift, rotation, zoom, shear (Stretch)
    |
    via performing bunch of such operations we can augment new images for given data point

- For each Data Pt in original data set, I'm augmenting the dataset

Que) Whu Data Augmentation is useful ??
 -> You can get several Invariances
     |
      - shear Invariance, rotation invariance, zoom invariance, shear invariance
        noise invariance

    Invariance := inp to output mapping doesn't changes when inp is changed slightly

    Thus this will help s.t my output doesn't changes when inp changes slightly due to Invariances

 -> If you have small dataset => you can create much larger dataset

=> Because you introduce invariance to the input dataset, the ConvNet Model you train become Invariant
   to certain invariances
