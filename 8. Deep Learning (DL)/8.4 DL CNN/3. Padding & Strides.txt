3. Padding & Strides
--------------------


----------
BASIC

-> When you want output image exactly as same dimen as inp image (after Convolution via kernel)
   then use Padding techniqye

=> Kernels are typically Square Matrix for most Image Processing


-----------

Remember in Convolution earlier
  |
  we have 6*6 Matrix of Image as Inp -> 3*3 kernel -> Output of 4*4 matrix

Formula :
  
  n*n -> k*k => (n-k+1)*(n-k+1)

=> Kernels are typically Square Matrix for most Image Processing

-> Padding & Stridings are used when you want your output Image Matrix of diff sizes 
    same or more as inp size => Padding
    same or less as inp size => Striding

[AIM] <--
Q) What if you want output Image exactly same size as Inp ie other than (n-k+1) x (n-k+1)
   -> Padding

* Padding :
  -------	
   convert output matrix to diff dimen than one derived from formula
   Eg
      4*4 -> 6*6   // n=6, k=3
      6*6 -> 8*8   // n=8,, k=3

   Idea :- increase rows & cols as boundary to each side of inp matrix

   => If ypu pad it by 1 extra layer on all side then p=1

   So when you have n*n matrix & if you pad it by 1 => you get (n+2)*(n+2) matrix

  Q) What values to put in there to added layers ??
   
    -> Zero Padding


* Zero Paadding :
  ---------
   - used a lot in CNN

* Same Val Padding :
  ----
   - take val present in nearest (col or rows)	
   - not used extensively


Case 1 :- Simple Convolution
   |
    ->  n*n -> k*k => (n-k+1)*(n-k+1)

Case 2 :- Padding, Convolution
   |
    -> n` = n+2p   // p is padding factor
       n*n -> k*k => (n+2p-k+1)*(n+2p-k+1)

Case 3 :- Stride, padding, Convolution


* Striding :
  ---------
   - Moving of Window on Inp Image by Kernel (one by one)

   - In simple Convolution, Kernel shift by 1 Column or 1 Row at a time
     &
     this is called as shifted by 1 Stride (Step)

   - stride by 2 (s=2)
       - means it can shift in horizontal or vertical by 2

   => Strides helps you reduce the size of Matrix

   Eg n*n matrix -> stride of s & k*k kernel => (n-k/s + 1)*(n-k/s + 1)

      Thus in case of Strides, n*n matrix becomes smaller

-------

=> Thus 2 techniqye can be used to get diff size Matrix output during Convolution * Kernel
    
    1) Padding is used to get same or more dimen on output

    2) Stride is used when you need to reduce the size in output
