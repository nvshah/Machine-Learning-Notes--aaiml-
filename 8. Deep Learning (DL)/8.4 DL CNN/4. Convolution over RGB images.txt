4. Convolution over RGB images (Color Images)
----------------------------


------

=> THus in case of Color Images, We have 3D Kernels (ie Tensors) that act with inp img
=> 3d tnsors are often called as Volumes

-------

- Till now we seen Convolution GrayScale Images (ie 0 or 255)

- In case of Color Images each pixel hold info in form RGB (Red, green, Blue) :- triplet

* RGB & Color Img :
  ----
   - one way of thinking is that RGB image is combination of 3 images
      1. Red Image
      2. Green Image
      3. Blue Image 
[IMP]
  => Color Image can be represented as 3D tensor

-> 3Dd tensor are often referred as "Volumes"


* Convolution on 3D tensor | Matrix :
  -------
   -> #channels between kernel & inp 3D tensor must be same
   - now cuboid over inp Image's cuboid
   - Output is 2D matrix

   - Conv operator on input color image generates a 2D image still


- All in all 
  ---
   - In case you think of earlier as Rectangle & Squares
     |
     we need to think over cube & Cuboid

   - Channel cnts needs to be same (except all things works)
