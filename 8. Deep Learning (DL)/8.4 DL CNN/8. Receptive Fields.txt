8. Receptive Fields & Effective Receptive Fields
------------------

=> In Reality You will have multiple Convolution Kernel, Whose Weights we learn through back-propogation

GIST

=> Effective Receptive Field becomes imp when you have multi-layered CNN	   
=> Effective Receptive Field is much larger in the Original Image

* Receptive Field (Part) :
  ---
   - It is that part of an image which Convolution Kernel Operates on at particular instant of time.
     |
     portion of Inp Image that is being Convoluted by the Kernel to geenrate some part of Output at a time is called as Receptive Part of Image

   - Receptive Portion of Inp Image keep changing with time.

   - Receptive Field is that part of image which at given time t is convoluted with Kernel

[NOTE]
=> In Reality You will have multiple Convolution Kernel, Whose Weights we learn through back-propogation
   \
    So multiple kernels, effectively output a Tensor
    (as single layer outputs a Layer)


* Effective Receptive Field :
  ----
   Part of original Image whose pixels are being convoluted by kernels in further layers deep in NN

   Effective Receptive Field depends on multiple things such as 
    - stride param, padding param, etc...

   => The effective region of original img whose pixels has directly/indirectly contributed to the Convolution Kernel present at diff level is called as Effectove Receptive Field 
       \
        So all those pixels (of Effective Receptive Field) in original img is indirectly being Convoluted by the Kernel at diff layers correspondingly

   => Effective Receptive Field becomes imp when you have multi-layered CNN

   => Effective Receptive Field is much larger in the Original Image
