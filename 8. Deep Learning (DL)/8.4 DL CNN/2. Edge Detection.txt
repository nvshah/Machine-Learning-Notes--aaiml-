2. Edge Detection 
---------------
Convolution; Edge Detection :
---------------------------

ref :- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator

------
NOTE

Image := Matrix of Pixel

Convolution :- Kinda Dot Product (but for Matrices)  // ie Elem wise Product & then Add

-----
REMEMBER

CORRECTION :- Instead of taking zero pixel value as white, it is customary to take zero as black and 255 as white. 

_______


* Convolution : to detect an edge

* Convolution Matrix :
  ----
   filter, Mask, Operator

-> We detect edges on given inp image matrix by applying Convolution Operator

* Operation of Convolution via Edge Detection
  --------

* Sobel Horizontal Edge Detector :
  ----
   - 3*3 matrix
   - act as an operator
   - helps to detect an horizontal edgesdge

   -> [[+1, +2, +1]
       [0, 0, 0]
       [-1, -2, -1]]

   => Applying Convolution via Sobel Horizontal Edge Detector
      ---- 
      - Component wise multiplication & then adddition (with Input Image Matrix)
      - You can normalize the output of convolution (after sobel is applied)
        So that you can get edge idea of light & dark regions

      - The whiter it is in ouput, the more horizontal it is !

[REMEMBER]
=> Wherever you have edges, we will have white colors in output
    &
   rest we will have black color	

=> The more contrast, the mmore deeper white it is

* Sobel Vertical Edge Ddetector :
  ----
   - use to detect vertical edge from image
   - It is also called as Soble Vertical (3*3) Kernel

GIST

* Convolution Operation :
  -----
   - Elem wise Multiplication & then addition (Given 2 Matrix)
   - Generalization of Dot Product 
      \
       Convolution is done for Matrices
       Dot Product is done for 2 Vectors
