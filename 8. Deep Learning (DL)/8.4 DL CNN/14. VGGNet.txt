----
Remember :-

-> At the end finally you will have fully connected layer (ie Flatten one from Tensor)

---

- It's a better version of AlexNet
     (Simpler form of AlexNet) 
 
- In AlexNet wee have diff type of Kernel for Convoultion & Pooling also may differ
  
  Here we will use same type of Kernel in case of VGGNet
       &
       Same type of Max-Pooling as well
  |
  Simplification :- we will only use 3*3 matrix Kernel &
                    Sride = 1
                    Max Pool Kernel size is 2*2 with stride = 2

- 2 Kinda Networks
  \
   VGG-16,  VGG-19   (16 layers & 19 layers)
     
   -> at lot places VGG networks are used (esp for Computer Vision)


=> All Convolution Kernel are of 
      - 3*3
      - Stride = 1
      - padding = 'same'

   All Max-Pools has same :-- 2*2 size & stride=2

   -> This will simplify the model

--------

* Keras & VGG16
  ---
   -> There is ImageNet Dataset

      this VGG16 model is trained on this ImageNet Dataset & you cann get model with all weights built in (ie Pre-Exisitng in keras)

   - Pre-Trained VGG16 Model.

   -> trained model is available in Keras for VGG16
