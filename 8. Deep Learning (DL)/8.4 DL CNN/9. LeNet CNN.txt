____________

- Convolution :- via Kernel
      \
       -> (getting diff aspects of Inp Image via diff Kernels)

  SubSampling :- is kinda Mean/Avg Pooling


* Eg - MNIST
  ---
  Inp Img -> GrayScale

     After pass through 2 round of Convolution followed by SubSampling (ie Avg Pooling)
     we will have 2D Matrix form Output then onwards we can do MLP (ie Fully Connected Network)
     & at end we can have layer of Activation like Sigmoid or SoftMax
