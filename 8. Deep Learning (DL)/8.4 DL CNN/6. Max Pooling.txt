- Max Pooling
  Mean Pooling (Sub Sampling)

------

* Pooling
  ---
  - layer you can add to your CNN
  
  INVARIANTS:

  - Location Invariant  // regardless of the position, I would like to detect it
  - Scale Invariant   // regardless of the size/scale, I would like to detect it.
  - rotation Invariant  // 

  -> Pooling is the concept that makes your model slightly invariant to/as all of above them
     (ie Thus Pooling has its inspiration from abovee kinda invariance things)

* Max Pooling :- 
  ---
   - You can think Max-Pooling as a Kernel
   - It introduce invariance to the whole System


* Most Used Component of Sample NN :

   Conv, RELU, Max-Pooling
