- MNIST is actually Image Dataset

- Archi 

  Conv (RELU) -> Conv (Relu) -> MmaxPool() -> Flatten -> Dense Layer -> dropout -> Dense Layer


* For Image Data :-
   
   You have 2 Option

   1. Flatten Img & leverage the MLP 

   2. Use ConvNet as it has plus of Convolution Operator which can leverage structure in Image (like 
      Shape, Edge, etc...)


=> ConvNet are Special Archi Design Specifically for Image Dataset
