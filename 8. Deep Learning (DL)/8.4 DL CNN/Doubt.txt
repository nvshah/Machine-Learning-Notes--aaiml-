Q1) Derivative of Max-Pooling

    What if some cell value changes more rapidly than other adjacent cell in same grp
    then do we need to change derivative update Logic in-between (ie 1 or 0) in case of maxPooling ??

    Que Ref Video :- 
       Sec 4.7 CNN training: Optimization, (time: 6:46 PM)

    Consider Eg :-
       \
         1  3                                            0  0
         2  4    =>  Max-Pooling -> 4  So Derivative ->  0  1

         Now if same above cell after sometime becomes

         2  5
         4  4    => then Max-Pooling -> 5 
                    Then according to Derivative Logic (Custom) => 0  0 
                                                                   0  1
