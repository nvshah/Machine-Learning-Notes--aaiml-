* CNN (Conv Nets)	
  _______________
  
  - design for visual tasks (ie like MNIST)
  - Eg Face, Car, Tiger - What Object Exists in Image
     |
     Object Recognition Tasks

  - Computer Vision :- Blennd of AI|ML + Image|Visual


* Historical Perspective :
  ---
   Cat :- given anesthesia

   Visual Cortex :- part of brain

   Human Brain also has multiple layer of Visual System 

* Visual Cortex :
  ---
   - Region for Visual in Brain
   - many area in visual cortex  (ie V1, V2, V3,...)
   - V1 area : primary visual cortex
        -> Edge detection

   So there are some neurons that focus on  & detect
      - Edge Detection
      - Motion
      - Depth
      - Color
      - Shapees

   -> Complex Neurons : for lot of varyinng kind of tasks (ie detection)
      There are special neurons responsible for diff kinda tasks

   There is layer wise connection from v1 -> v2 -> v3 ...
     |
     diff area of cortex will play role accordingly then
     => Edges - > grouped into regions - > grouped into objects  // as level go higher

   => There is nice Hierarchical Structure of Layers of Diff Area of Visual Cortex that can be 
      simulated via MLP

---

-> Img Processing may include Signal Processing

=> Image Processing, Computer Vision & Signal Processing is lot of inspired by this biological system
   i.e Edge Detection, Motion,...


----
(From Video Youtube)

=> Flow of Visual Info in Brain involves many diff area of Visual Cortex

-> Objects in real world has boundaries & these boundaries are aligned to diff orientations	
   
-> Earlier stage of Visual Processign seems to involve the deetection of edges & orientation
   &
   later stages may involve the processing

-> Activity of Brain Cells represent some stimuli in the wolrd
