Doubt

1) Auto Enncoder & Dimen Reduction
   -------------------------
   -> At the end if we are having same dimension in output as input, then what is 
      dimensionality reduction done or achieved ??

   Is it that we need to Consider the Hidden layer for the above consideration ??
   -> IF yes then in case of MLP with multiple hidden layers, which one to pick as reduction layer consideration ??	


   Ans 2) 
    -> You can have multi layers with different sizes for eg.

	1st hidden layer of size 5

	2nd of size 4 and 3rd of size 3.

	Now suppose you want the compressed representation of size size 3 you can select the output of 3rd layer and if you want compressed reperesentation of size 5 you can use the output of first hidden layer.

	So basically it depends on your requirement.
