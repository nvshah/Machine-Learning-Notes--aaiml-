- Core written in :- C/C++
  Interface on Top of it :- Python, JS, Java, ...

  Versions :- TensorFlowLite

------

* Tensor :- 
  ----
   - mathematical terms
   - tensor := n-dimensional array

   - thus tensor is genearlization of concepts such as vector, matrix, cube, ...

   - DL is all abt Tensor Operations

   Flow :
   ---
    - related to backward Propogation
    - flow of derivative in backward direction
   
   - TensorFlow code gives you lot of Low-Level Control

   => When you required change Low-Level Structure lot :- TensorFlow is useful


* Keras :
  ------
   - Its a High Level Library
   - Easy to learn
   - fewer lines of Codes

   2 Option for Backend :- (ie Code Underhood) 
       - TensorFlow 
       - Theano

   - Keras can talk with TensorFlow or Theano
   - Keras is kinda High-Level library

* Others :
  -----
   - PyTorch, MxNet

* Conclusion :
  --------
   - If you are not doing some research kinda work then Go for Keras
   - If you are not doing some complex Deep NN related Stuff then also you can opt Keras
