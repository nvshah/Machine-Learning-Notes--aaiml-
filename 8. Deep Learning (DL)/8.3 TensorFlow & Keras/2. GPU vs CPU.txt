TERMS

- VRAM

-----
REMEMBER 

-> CUDA is onne of the tool to program the underhood of GPU's such as Nvidia GPU
=> GPU are fast if you have paralleilizable Tasks

-----

* GPU := Graphic Processing Unit
  CPU := Central Processing Unit

  GPU -> more with DL

* CPU :
  ---
   - Cores :- can run in parallel
     Cache :- shared between cores

     Cores & Cache lie on same chip  // Computation Unit
     RAM  // Memory Unit

=> RAM & CPU do not lie on same chip

    -> for General Purpose

   - Cores can be 8, 6, 4

   - Operates at 2GHz

* GPU :-
  ----
   - Cores can be :- 100, 1000,...
   - thus GPU cores are slower but there are many of them

   * Distributed Cache :-
     ---
     -> Sum of All cache from all those cores is known as `VRam`

   - It can do lot of paraller operation

   - operates at 400MHz

   How GPU works with Data :-
   -> 1. It obtains data from RAM
      2. Distribute it amongst all of its core in best possible way

   CUDA :
   ---
    -> Its kinda a tool or programming interface to work with the GPU	
    - Can help to define how data from RAM should split among Distributed Cache !

   -> GPU can run more tasks in parallel than CPU (as it has more cores)

 [**]
 => GPU are fast if you have paralleilizable Tasks


* DL & GPU :
  -----
   DL - has lots of Matrix Mul & Addition
      - ie tensor operations
      - thus GPU suits its needs

   Thus as Lots of DL operations are parallelizable, GPU is best option for computation

   -> GPU turns out to be 10 to 100 times faster


* VRAM & Significnace :
  -----
   -> VRAM is sum of all Distributed cache memory in GPU chip

   -> More the VRAM := 	More complex tasks you can consider to Modeled or to attained
