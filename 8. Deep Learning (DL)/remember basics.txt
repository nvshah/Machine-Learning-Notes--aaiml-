Imp Topics in Modern DL :-
---
-> RELU, Batch Normalization, Dropout

_____

=> Data Normalization is Mandatory 

=> Vanishing Gradient becomes Severe in Extreme Cases


* Batch vs Epoch ??
   
   -> ref : https://machinelearningmastery.com/difference-between-a-batch-and-an-epoch

   batch size :- #samples processed before model is updated
   Epoch :- Entrire pass through the Train Data

   Eg total data :- 200 samples
      batch size :- 5
      total batches :- 40 Batches

      So in each epoch batch considered :- 	40 Batches

[Regularization]
=> regularization removes all useless Weights

=> Initial layers in CNN often deal with the task of detecting the Borders, Common Shapes & Likewise
   (which is common among all tasks esp when we talk about Images)

=> Keep Small Learning Rates when you FineTune Your Model

TensorFlow/Keras :- allows to add diff regularization at diff layers

-> Depth of Kernel is same as depth of input image
=> Depth of Kernel will be same as depth onf Inp Tensor I've

=> Max-Pooling does not have any Trainable Param
