2. Diagramatic Perceptron
--------------------

* Logistic Regression from Neural Network Perspective :
  -----------------------------------\

 -> Concept of SGD to solve LogReg or LrReg is used extensively whilst working with Neuron
    interpretation (ie Neural Network) as well !

 - Train a NN := means compute/find the weights on edges/vertices

 - We made a Sigmoid as a Activation Function


* Perceptron :
  ----------
   - The diff between Perceptron & Logistic Regression is of Activation Function
   - You can think of Perceptron as Linear Classifier as well (at its simple)

  Simplified Neuron:
  ---
   Neurons either Fires or not Fires
     if fires -> output 1
     else     -> output 0

  Note : (Perceptron vs LogisticReg)
  --
   In case of Perceptron, However there is no Squashing
   whereas
   In case of Logistic Reg, there is Squashin in range 0 --> 1

  How to train Perceptron ??
   -> SGD at its disposal 

  Training the Perceptron means := computing the Weights

=> Thus LogReg & Perceptron can be considered as Single neuron Simple Models
   The only diff is of Activation Fn (ie Squashing terms)
