0. History of Neural Network
-----------------------

* Perceptron :
  -----
   - simplest NN based model
   - Intutively its similar to Logistic Regression

-> Biological Inspiration (loosely inspired ie not exact expectation)

* bilological Neuron vs Artifical Neuron 
  ------
   - Some electrical pulses coming inside
   - it does somme computation
   - it then sends out pulses outside (possibly to other neuron)
   
   [artifical]
   Some of the inputs have more importance than other (so Weights are used)


* Network of Neurons :
  ----
   - Structure of Neurons
   - In a typical brain, we have network of Neurons

   Can we mimic this Structure ??
    \
     -> Back Propoagation Algo 

* Back Propogation Algo is just Chain Rule with some hack

* AI-Winter :
  ----
   - Time around 1990's
   - When funding for AI dried out

-------

* Jeff Hinto & Neural Networks 
  -----
   -> Rise of Deep NN  // in 2006
    - It is Deep Learning Foundation thing

* ImageNet Competition (StanFord)
  -----
   - 2012, Image -> Object   // Evolution of ML as DL	
   - better by Deep Learning (Evolve)

   - since 2012, DL was taken seriously
         \
          {Google, FB, Microsoft, Baidu}

* Golden Days of NN (DL) : (Later 2012)
    (Why ?)
	1) Lots of Data
	2) lots of Computational Resources
	3) New Algorithms

--------
* Great Applications
  
   - Voice Assistant 
      Eg { Siri, Cortona, Google Assistant, alexa }

   - Self Driving (Tesla, Google Waymore)
