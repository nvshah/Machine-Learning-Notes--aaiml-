7. Training a MLP : Memoization
--------------------------

* Memoization :
  -----------
  -> software engineering trick 
  -> Code Once ReUse multiple times

  - There are certain derivative terms which are being used multiple times among multiple path
    or ammong network
    So we can use memoize vals for next time (during updation)

* Back Propogation := (Algo)
  --------------------
  => Thus Chain Rule + Memoization (to avoid Recomputation) := Back-Propagation
