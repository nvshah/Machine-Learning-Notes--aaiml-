1. Biological Neurons
---------

------
NOTE

=> All biological learning is nothing but Weights on Neural Circuits (Connections)


------
-> Weights & Connnections play imp part in Learning 

_________

* Neuron :
  ---
   - is activated/Fired (whenn there is enough dendrite)

   Mathematical Idea for Output :-
   ----
    -> Output := Func(Sum())   // Sum() is summation of weighted inputs


* Logistic Regression & neuron :
  -----
   -> Till now we saw Logistic Regression in terms of Plane seperatin 2 space

   -> We will see LogReg in terms of neuron & thus perceptron concept will be coined 


-------
(Growth of Bilogical Neurons)

* Biological NN :
  -----
   - Cell Body (ie Neuron)
     Dendrides
     Axons

   - Inter-connection of above neuron is biological NN 


=> When you born you have some neuron

* Note 
   - The more dense the brain evolve, the more calories it requires
   - Uptil some age (let say, Teenage) the Biological Neural Network will grow towards more dense sense
     But
     Later it will start neural Degeneration ie. some of networks will repeal|removed

* Neural Degeneration :
  --------
   - because our body becomes weak, brain also gets affected
     &
     thus some of neurons dies
     ie Some of connection gets degenerated !

* Early Stage : (Initial Data Interaction)
  --------
   - During first six years, Human consumes lots of Data
      \
       they experience data from several ways : {visual, audio, video, family, sensory }
   
   -> Later new connection are formed based on the data realized/interacted at earlier stage


* Neural Circuit :
  --------
   -> will learn from experiments 

   Eg 
   let say small child dont know abt hot plate
    |
    So he touches the hot plate & feel much pain
    |
    later nnext time he will think before touching hot plate
      \
       because of 2 reasons
          - prev learning of own experiment (neural circuits)
          - or his parents told him explicitly too be aware of same
