* Hill Climbing Analogy :
  --------------------

* loss & Weights Correspondence:
  ---------
   -> Loss is just a Func over Weights
   -> Loss(w) :- just a way to represent the vector|matrix form to scalar form


* Contout Lines :
  --------
   -> All the Point that are at same Height (in 2D Convex Fn Plot (ie Hyperbola let say))
       \
       then they form a ring (of path) & that line is known as Contour Line

   -> Helps to Visualize the Higher Dimension Plot
       \
        Visualizinng the 3D plots in 2D surface

   -> By looking at the Contour Plots we can have Idea where the local Minima|maxima can be !!

   -> by looking at Contour, You can tell if its Saddle Point or Minima|Maxima


* Saddle Point:
  -------
   - Appears as minima from 1 Side
     whereas
     If looked at from other side it appears as a Maxima
