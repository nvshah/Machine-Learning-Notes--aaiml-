7. SGD & GD | Momentum
----------------

* Updation Ways :
  ----

  W_t = W_t-1 + {eta}*GRAD   // GRAD expect to grab its value via GD

  1. All the Points Consideration := GD (Gradient Descent)
  2. Using only 1 Point at a time := SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)
  3. Using batch of points randomly picked := mini-batch SGD

  => Now-a-days Mini-Batch SGD is used widely


* GD vs Mini-Batch SGD correspondence :
  ---------------------------------
  (IMP)
  =! Derivative Commputed during Mini-Batch SGD is not exatcly equal to Derivative computed during Gradient Descent

  Ideally We want the the derivative val to be calculated via GD
  |
  but considering large number of point at same time becomes impractical sometime
  So we use Mini-Batch SGD to approximate to GD

  NOTE :- 
    -> Mini-Batch SGD results may possess some Noisy|Errorneous vals
    -> We are expecting val found via GD as ideal for comparision


* GD vs SGD Convergence :
  -------------
  => Through GD, path you will take will always lead towards best|optimal point(location)

  SGD is rough approx to GD

  Core Idea (SGD | GD) := take lots of iterations to reach the Minima|Maxima (ie end goal)

  => In SGD, We will move in some directions but eventually possibly we will reach the goal
     Whereas 
     In GD, We will try to move to end goal (as straigh forward as possible)

  -> Thus in above view We can say that GD is the ideal way to reach the Goal in Optimization
     ( As it tends to follow the Straight path towards the end goal )

  - Thus iterations required in SGD will be more compare to GD, generally (Theoretically !)
     |
     GD will converge in fewer steps

     But the cost of Computing GD is v.large so we are choosing the SGD


* SGD & Noisy Updates :
  -----------
  - In case of GD, it will be Straigh-Forward in reachinng towards optimal point
  - In case of SGD, each of the updates are more noisy as compare to GD


* De-Noising the Gradients From SGD :
  --------------------
   -> So as to converge faster
   -> SGD + Momentum => Some great concept to
