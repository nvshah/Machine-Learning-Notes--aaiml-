- Gaussian Mixture Model + K-Means

-> Convolution is a concept from Signal Processing

=> Image is just Matrix

=> NOTE :
   the kernel used in Computer Vision is for Convolution
   The kernel used in SVM is for Projecting Data to Higher Dimensions

--------------

* Modern Computer Vision
  - Digital Signal Processing
  - Image Processing
  - ML, DL,
    (Matrix Algebra), SOTA
  - Computational Photography  (Lots of Mobile Devices offer this in camera feature)
  - MultiView Geometry
    - task to create geometry of an image via multiple views capture by the Camera of an image

-> OpenCV is most influential library in Computer Vision

-----

* Problem 1 : Image Blending
---------------------------

* Image & RGB & Matrix
 -----
 - You can think image as combination of 3 matrices (ie each matrix corresp to R, G, B)
 - Img is stack of Matrices (R, G, B)

 - Lots of Img Processing Operation are Matrix Operations

 - Img Blending :- Addition of matrices of 2 diff images
    |
     - Weighted Matrix Addition
        - Providing some weights to pixels of corresp Image
 => Thus Image Blending is simply weightage addition of matrices

 * Img Resizing : Interpolation, BiCubic Interpolation

 - Gamma : you can use gamma to adjust darkness or lightness of the image
    \
     Will be added at the end after applying Weighted value for resultant pixels


* Problem 2 : Video Survellience :
------------------------------

- Background is Fixed, often
  Task : Detect person in video

- Video : Seq of images (ie Frames 24 or 32 fps)

* Image Subtraction : (Background Subtraction)
-> Simplest way to detect moving obj in video is via Subtraction of diff frames(ie Images)

-> With the help of OpenCV lib, you can read each frame of Video as an Image

* BackGroundSUbtractionMOG
  ----
  MOG : mixture of Gaussians

  -> Background Segmentation
  - Foreground Background Algorithm
    \
     Foreground :- new item are appearing/detected
     Backgound :- Stationary part


* Problem 3: Image Blurring using Convolution
--------------------------------------
  (Signal Processing Kinda Problem)

 => Convolution is a concept from Signal Processing

 - Try to place Convolution Kernel on each of possible places in image you can plcae it.

 -> We can use Image Convolution for Blurring the images
 -  Convolution is 1 way of averaging

 -> Gaussian Kernel, Denoising Kernel

 - Gaussian Blur
    \
     In Gaussian Center has large weight & as you go away its small weight

 - Median Blurring

QUE) Convo NN vs Classical Img Processing
  ->
   Convo NN :- kernels are learnt from the data
   Img Processing :- often things are HandCrafted based on Research


-------------------

* Extra

- Shift Features
- Image Statistics
