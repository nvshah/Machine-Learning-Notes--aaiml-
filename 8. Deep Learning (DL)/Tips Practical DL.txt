Tips Practical DL 

* MLP (NN) :
  -----
   - while doing it keras & tensorflow way, you can use Violin Plots to see distribution of Weight among diff Hidden Layers


* CNN :
  ---
   -> general CNN Convnet includes :

       - ConvLayer -> MaxPooling 
       - Flatten -> Dese layers 
       -> DropOut

* RNN :
  ---

  -> LSTM are a lot more tricky to understand how it works



---------

* tensorboard:


* UpSampling2D  // for UNets  (Image Segmentation)
