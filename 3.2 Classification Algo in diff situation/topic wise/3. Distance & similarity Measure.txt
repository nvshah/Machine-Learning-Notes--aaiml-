3. Distance & similarity Measure

* K-NN, Given a Distance|Similarity Measure :
  -------------------------------------
   -> It may be hard to represent the pt as a numerical vector

      Eg any medicine i.e paracetamol 
                           \
                            -> hard to represent as vector 
      given 2 points (i.e paracetamol), domain expert can tell if they are similar or not.
  
      So sometimes we dont get Xi's as vector
      but
      We may get it as similarity matrix

      i.e instead of converting all chemicals into a num-vector
          its easy for them to fill similarity matrices for pair of chemicals

    => Thus Similarity Matrix or Distance Matrix instead of Xi points (i.e d-dimen vector) explicitly

    -> Given Similarity Matrix or Distance Matrix, KNN will work (as it requires distance to its 
       neighbour only) well
        but
       Logistic regression won't work easily as it needs explicitly the vector repr of points in d-dimen
