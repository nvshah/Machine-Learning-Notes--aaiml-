1. Imbalanced dataset

* Imbalanced vs Balanced Dataset : 
  ------------------
    1) Balanced Dataset :- 

      - Good balance betn +ve & -ve pts
      - roughly equal
      - disparity less

    2) Imbalanced Dataset :

      - 1 class dominating over other
      - Majority Class | Dominating class : class with more points
      - Eg Medicine Diagnostic (Cancer)
           ECommerce           (90% cust who visit not buy)

      problem-1
      - Not always but in some cases its possible that majority|dominating class will be biased
        i.e Dominating class will have undue impact
        ( Not fair just because of less population )

      problem-2
       - Dumb Model & Accuracy metric can result high for such models

    Q) How to Solve Imbalanced Dataset ?? 
      -> 1) UnderSampling
         2) OverSampling  { repeatation, Extrapolation, Class-Weight }

   * UnderSampling :  (Way 1)
     ----------
     	let say minority class C1 - #n1 
     	        majority class C2 - #n2

     -> Create a new data set from Imbalanced dataset :-
             - copy all minority class into new dataset as it is (ie #n1 from C1)
             - randomly sampled #n1 points from majority class C2 i.e n1 out of n2 points

             After this new Data set will be balanced with equal cnt of pts from both classes

       Problem with Under-Sampling :
       -----
        - as n2-n1 pts are thrown away from Class C2
          So new dataset has much less points than original one, 
          so our model have smaller amt of data so it may not work as well

        - So throwing away data is not good idea at all

    * OverSampling : (Way 2)
      ----------
        - work around to not loose data ie to not loose insights

        Way-1 : (Repeatation)
        --------------------
        - So try to repeat points of minority class to match the cnt of majority class pts
          i.e #n1 + k = #n2  // try to find k
             or
              #n1 * m = #n2
              Eg if #n1 = 100
                    #n2 = 900  
                    then k = 800 or #n1 * 9

        - repeat the points
        - geometrically, placing more points from the minority class in the dataset

        Way 2 : (Extrapolation)
        ----------------------
        idea :- instead of just repeating point on top of itself
                try to create artifical/synthetic points from available points in that region

        Such a way of creating artifical/synthetic points from available (i.e minority class region) points
        is called as Extrapolation

 		    way 3 : (Class- Weight)
 		    ---------------------
 		    idea :- same as repeatation but virtually
     		provide weights to your class & consider them whilst finding the neighbours
     			\
     			 Provide higher weight to minority class
     			 Provide smaller weight to majority class

     			 So while exploration, if any pt from minority interacted then consider (weight * pt)

    * Another Problem 2 with Imbalanced Dataset : (Dumb Model)
      --------------
       -> Can get high `accuracy` with imbalanced dataset with a dumb model

       Dumb Model :- Model where majority of points dominate the rest one 
                     (so no need to do any calc for pred, just predict majority class & accuracy will be  
                      high thereby)

                  Eg Model which says every point is almost -ve is a dumb model.
