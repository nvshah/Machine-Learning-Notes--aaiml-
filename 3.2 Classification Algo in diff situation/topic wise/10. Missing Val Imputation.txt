10. Missing Val Imputation

* Missing Value Imputation :
  --------------------
   => In real world there are lots of missing val
   -> missing val in features/col

    - Data Corruption
    - Data collection error

    - filling missing val techniques (3) :- 

    *) Imputation :
       -----
        - done as a preprocessing step
        - replace with something

        -> { Mean, Median, Mode }

        2) Mean Imputation (For Class Label):
           -----
        	* If Classification 0, 1
          
           	  Then do mean replacement based on class-label i.e 
              	If Xi -> f3 missing then 
                    if Xi -> yi = 1 => mean of f3 for all pts that have label = 1
                                = 0 => mean of f3 for all pts that have label = 0

              => mean imputation of relative population instead of entire population (in case of 
                 classification problem/objective)


        3) New missing value feature
           -----
            Missing feature val can also be a source of some information sometime

             - create a new binary data-matrix with same size as original one
               this binary matrix will keep record/track of val missing or not in original dataset
               (Whether inn original data this was missing or not !!!)

             - Impute the original matrix

            As missing val sometimes can be informative, we can use binary matrix to check whenever required.

        4) Model based Imputation :
           ------
            -> try to predict missing val using model-algorithm

            -> Convert particular feature/col where there are missing val as predicted feature /column
               & try to put missing val pts in test set
                 train with available pts & then predict missing val

            For classification - KNN 
                Regression     - Any regression model

            => KNN is often used for Model based Imputation 
                \
                 As it has concept of neighborhood & relative assumption

            => Takes significantly more time to run.
