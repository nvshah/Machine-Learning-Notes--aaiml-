9. Categorical & Ordinal Val

* Feature Transformation :
  ---------------

* Categorical & Ordinal features :
  ---------------------------
   given features possess some numerical & some categorical

   If we convert categorical into numerical -> then Ordering also get artifically generated 
                                               (as numbers have order inherently)
                                               Thus artifical order gets generated

   So converting categorical features into a numerical features is not a good idea (as some relation gets introduced i.e order relation)

   2) One-Hot Encoding :
      -------------
      - technique to encode categorical random variables 

      - convert feature to a binary vector of size = #categories in that feature

      NOTE => BOW & one-hot encoding are relative in terms of idea
      
      Problem :
      	Lousy when there are many categories vals in features
        	ie for 1 pt require large size binary vector

        - dimensionality will incr
        - vector will be almost sparse

      Solution (may be):

   3) Mean Replacement :
      --------------
        - to convert Categorical feature
        - It is very very objective-specific (problem-specific)

        - replace that col vals with avg val of predicted-var (output-var) category-wise
          i.e
          mean-val of y_i (output feature to predict) for each category of that column

          Eg 2 [objective : predict height]
          		cols y_i = country & y_j = height <- output feature 
          		 then replace country col with country_height (i.e mean val of height for each country)


   4) Domain Knowledge :
      ----
       -> to convert Categorical feature
       -> requires well knowledge (& relativity concept)


   5) Ordinal features :
      --------------
     - features that can be ordered
     - Categorical features which can relate with ordinal vals (i.e orderness)
     - Categorical feature & logical Ordering among them so can be converted to numerical feature

       Eg ratings feature :- {v.good, good, bad, v.bad}

                             {4, 3, 2, 1}
                             {10, 6, 4, 2}
