2. Multi Class Classification

* Multi-Class Classifictaion :
  ----------------
    Eg Mnist Dataset {0,...,9}

    - KNN is easy to extend to Multi-Class Classification
    - Whereas Logistic regression can only do binary classification & not multi-class classifcation

    So Some algo can extend easily to multi-class classification whereas some not.

    * Multi-Class to Binary-Classifier
      -------------------------------
       idea :- pick each class & verify for them individually making them isolate from rest

       Technique :- 1 vs rest
                    --------
       let Yi is from {1,2,3,...,c}   // c classes

       - prepare c binary classifier models
       - at each time 2 classes will be <i or not i>

       So i=1 -> f(i) -> C1 -> 1 or not 1
            2         -> C2 -> 2 or not 2

            c         -> Cc -> c or not c

      Thus Multi-Class Classification gets converted to c binary classification problems
