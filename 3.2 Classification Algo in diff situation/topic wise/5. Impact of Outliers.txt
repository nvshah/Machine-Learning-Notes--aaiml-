5 Impact of Outliers

* Impact Of Outliers :
  ------------------
   - Any model is easily understood by looking at decision surface

   Consider KNN :- 
       lesser value of K, - is more prone to Outliers/Noise
                          - impact of outlier is big

       Prefer large value of K, if there is tie in accuracy, (as large val of K is less prone to Outlier)
   
   => Or If you can detect Outliers, then remove them 
         but 
             If it's 2D or 3D then you may have chance to detect it visually
             But if its 10-D or 1000-D then you can't visually detect outliers easily

        There is 1 technique to detect outliers :- `Local Outlier Factor`

* Local Outlier Factor : (LOF)
  ---------------------

   1. Outlier detection using avg-distance :
     -------
      - take any val of K in K-NN
	  - calculate K neighbours for each point & find avg-distance
	  - sort the avg-distance in incr order
	  - the largest distance will be outlier 

	  Problem :- Cannot detect all outliers (i.e Outlier belong to dense grp)

	  			 NOTE :- In real world all data will not grp into single grp
	             If there are groups such as Sparse & Dense groups &
	             Outliers corresponds to both grp
	            -> then outlier to dense grp may not get detect but outlier of sparse grp will be 
	               detected 

	            -> Problem is that outlier is not detected based on grp density for which it was detected 
	               as an outlier

   Workaround :- need to capture or consider what local density is !!!

   2. LOF :
     ----
       => It just aim to idenify so recognize those densities which differs by considerable ratio
          or value
       -> It is inspired from K-NN 

       k-distance(Xi) = distance to K-th pt from Xi
       Neighbour (Xi) = set of all K neighbours of Xi

       reachability-distance (x, y) = max(k-dist(x), dist(x, y))

     => local reachability density : lrd(Xi)
             - # points in some unit area  
                 (inverse of avg reachability distance of given pt to its K neighbours)

             - Intutively it will calcuate density, for any point in its locality

       ( LOF is associated woth lrd )

     => local outlier factor : lof(Xi)
             - avg lrd of points in neighbourhood of Xi *  1/lrd(Xi)

            1) LOF - high
                \
                 -> If density of points in my neighbourhood is large 
                    & density in my locality is small

            2) LOF - small
            	\
            	 -> If density in my locality is large (ie there are many points near me)
            	    & density of points in my neighbourhood is small

            SO if LOF is High - Outlier
                         Low  - Inlier
     
     -> If reachability-distance is small then lrd i.e density may be large but its not sufficient
        to determine outliers 

        LOF will solve the sparse-dense group outliers issue as it will be able to idenify density 
            diff of outliers for both type of group

     Steps :-
     ------
       1. calc LOF for all pts
       2. determine thresold LOF ( > thresold val will be considered as outliers)

       Where to set thresold ?? -> no exact ans
           -> Domain specific

    => Interpretability of LOF is not neat or well 
       (i.e if LOF is large then its bad but how much bad it is  !!!)
