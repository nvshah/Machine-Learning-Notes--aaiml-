7. Interpretability

* Interpretability :
  ---------------
   Model & BlackBox

   - Black Box Model -> concern with output but not say anything abt reasonings
   - Interpretable Model -> If model can give some reasoning abotu why particuar Output !

   If model can give some reasonings, then domain expert about that application field can interpret  it probably the reason with more ideas

   KNN as interpretable Model :
     Eg k = 7, Xq -> Yq = 1  & let say d = 10 (low dimensions)
        reasoning := all 7 nearest neighbour are from 1	

        Eg 7 patient are seems to be cancer +ve along with Xq  

            There are 10 tests conducted per patient

        These reasonings can help doctor to understand more idea intutively & he can tell
        Why all these persons i.e 8 where labelled 1 as +ve

    => K-NN is interpretable when d is small & k is small  
         [consider medical domain, but this may vary domain to domain]

    So for any classifcationn technique its imp to know if Model is interpretable

   => Model Interpretability is imp for all classification techniques
