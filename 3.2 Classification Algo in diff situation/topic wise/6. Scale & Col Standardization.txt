6 Scale & Col Standardization

* Scale & Column Standardization 
  -------------------

   Scale-difference :- 
   ---
   -> when scale/range of 2 features are different (ie 1-100 & 1-10)

      The variability of ranges differ but when we take difference i.e any Norm 
      then variability are not treated as per actual range

      i.e diff of 5 for range 1-100 is small compare to diff of 0.8 in range of 1-10
           \
            variability of 5 in 1-100 (only 5%) is less than variability of 0.8 in range 1-10 i.e (80%)

          but when we check final results w.o standardization we end having norm as 5 & 0.8 where 5 is considered larger than 0.8 i.e mathematically but logically that is not true 

      => Logically its not true because if Scale-difference

    Soution :- Column Standardization

   * Column Standardization :
     -------------
      Idea :- make values from diff scale/range make fall in 1 standard range

              mean = 0 & standadr-deviaton = 1

   => Since Eucledian distance gets impacted/affected by Scale
        \
         -> So perform Col-Standardization beofore determining model 
            as KNN uses Eucledian distance to calculate NN
