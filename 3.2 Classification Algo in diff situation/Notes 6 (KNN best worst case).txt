* Best Case & Worst Case :
  -----------------
   (KNN)

   1) When dimenn is not large, KNN is good

      When dimen is large -> Curse of dimen (as Euc dist)
                          -> Interpretability decr
                          -> KDTree/LSH runtime complexity incr

   2) Low-Latency System 
      ---------
      -> result fast
       
      - Any internet applications are said to be low-latency systems
      - KNN should not be used for Low-latency system

   3) Find the right distance measure 
      -------
       i.e Cosin-Sim or Euc-Dist or Manhatten-dist ???

       -> KNN is good if you known otherwise KNN is not good choice
       -> Or if Distance/Similarity Matrix is given then its good to choose KNN
