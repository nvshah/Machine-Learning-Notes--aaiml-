* RS Types

REMEMBER

-> Content based filtering is very similar to Classif/Regression except for Featurization part

* Content based RS & Collabarative Filtering RS :
  ----------

* Collabarative Filtering :
  --------
   - based on user's pattern suggest system(movie)
   - uses collabarative data that user's shared

   Core Idea :- 
      - User's who agreed in the past tend to also agree in the future
      - Collaborate user's nature

   So decision for each user may involve study & obsv from diff user's interest


* Content based RS :
  -------
   - more like Classif & Regression

   - used cell val ie A_ij info
     and also we use some meta_info

   Eg Movie Category : action, drama, horror, sci-fi

   user like particular genere of movie & based on that we do recommedation
   -> Based on the content of the movie or based on the content of User we do filtering

   So decision for each user depends on user's activity itself from past

   So if you have innformation about Movie or Product & if you have information about User alongwith 
   User's ratings
   You can used Content Based Recommended System

=> Thus if you have information about User's & Movie alongwith Ratings then you can pose it as a 
   Standard classification/Regression Problem

=> Content based filtering is very similar to Classif/Regression except for Featurization part
