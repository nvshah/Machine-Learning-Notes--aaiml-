* Cold Start Problem 
  -------

  In RS :

  - Sometimes if User is new, there is no information about user's ratings activity
  - Sometimes when item/prosuct is new, there is no information about item's ratings

  such scenario is known as Cold Start Problem where you have new user or new items & 

  => In such case you can use Top items based on meta data

  => Handling the Cold Start Problem in RS :- `Content based RS is simplest idea`

* New User:
  -----
   - metadata for user

   For new user you will use the meta-data info from user & use the Content Based Recommended System to recommend

* New-Item :
  --------
   - meta-data for item

   You can recommend the similar items to user based on meta-data for new arriving items to already existing one
