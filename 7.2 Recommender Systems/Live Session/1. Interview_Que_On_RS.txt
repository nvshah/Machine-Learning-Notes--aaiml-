- Causal Inference
  A/B Testing

-> Industry used RecSys that are mostly Deep Learning Based (perspective)

=> All real time system are combination of Content based + Collaborative Filtering (ie Hybrid)

_______________

REMEMBER :
-> User cares about Recency
   (There is variance in even Single Day as per Morning, Evening, ...)


* Overview of Problem :
  - MF
  - Scale & Recency (item, to item)
  - Cold Start
  - Productionize
  - Retraining
  - Interpretability
  - Item Item & User-User Similarity Efficiently

  How to account time ??

----------------------------

* Spotify/Gaana :
----------------
  Constraints : Scale, Latency
   -> Lots of new users & songs & movies
   -> Mood Specific Songs
   -> Language specific
   -> Artists oriented
   -> Temporalness (80's song, Rock Song, pop song)

 Measure RecSys
   -> #Skipped Songs
   -> Time spent by User
   -> Songs added to playlist

 Historical Data : User, Time, Song

 Special Occasions based Information

=> Metrics & A/B Testing !

=> Tensor Factorization is Computational heavy & Harder
