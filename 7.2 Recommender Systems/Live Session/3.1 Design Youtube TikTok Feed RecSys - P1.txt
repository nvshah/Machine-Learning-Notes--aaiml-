3.1 Design Youtube Feed RecSys - P1
------------------------------------------
ref : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KJryu3DCCYDOfEVWj43nlHCa00W5vS-T/view

=> MF is time consuming (ie High Latency)

-----------------
Similar :- (problems)
TikTok Feed RecSys
Insta Reels RecSys
Youtube Shorts RecSys

Problem : (Goal)
-> User Retention


--------------------

* RecSys Gist

  Content Based :- U-U, I-I
  Collab Based :- MF

  DL based :- Wide & Deep NN

  NCF (Neural Collaborative Filtering) -> Genralization of RecSys
  Entity Embedding
  Transformer based MF

=> Low-Variance Content :- Same Repeated content recommended

-> More Heterogenity

* Explore-Exploit Strategy :
  ---
   -> Take some from region where user liked &
      Some from region from where user don't likes

   70% -> Exploit
   30% -> Explore

- NCF based Entity Embedding : Implicit + Explicit Features (accounts)

* Cluster based Explore-Exploit :
  ->
  - Pick random/popular videos from unseen clusters
=> pick based on user-User similarity

* Exponential Moving Trend/Weightage

* Offline System
  - Entity Embedding
  - V-V Clustering (heirarchical)
  - Approx NN (DS)
  - User User Clustering

  => Mostly its gonna be spark based syste,

* Online System (needed)
  - Serving System
  - Explore Exploit
  - Compute NN
  - Data Engg - Store User data
