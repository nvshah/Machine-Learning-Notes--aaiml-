___________
REMEMBER

-> PCA = Eigen Decomposition => performed on (Covariance Matrix) Squared Matrix 
   SVD = Singular Val Decomp => performed on any Rectangular Matrix
   
   Covariance Matrix is Squared & Symmetric Matrix

* Matrix Factorizations
  ----------

  A -> matrix
  \
   decompose A into product of other matrices (ie Factorization)


* PCA & MF :
  --------
  -> PCA is an example of Matrix Factorization

* Eigen Decomposition : (PCA)
  --------
  -> The Covariance Matrix S can be decomposed into 3 Matrices 
      ie
         S = M * Lama * M_transpose

         where each of them have d*d size or shape

         Lama :- Diagonal Matrix
           \
            -> hold the eigen values along the diagonal

  => Fundamentally PCA is doing Eigen Decomposition of Covariance Matrix (ie Matrix Factorization)  
  -> Thus PCA does MF using Eigen Vectors

=> PCA is often on Covariance Matrix (ie Squared Matrix)
-> Thus in case of PCA matrix will be Symmetric because it is Covariance Matrix 
   ( & Covariance Matrix is Square & Symmetric Matrix)


* Singular Value Decomposition : (SVD)
  ---------------
   - Its a Matrix Factorization Techniques that is related to PCA

   - It can be performed on any Rectangular Matrix
   - Thus to perform SVD, matrix need not to be Symmetric

   SVD :- X -> U * SIGMA * V^T 

               U :- n*n
               SIGMA :- n*d
               V^T :- d*d

   Singular Values :
   ---
   In case of SVD, middle matrix (ie SIGMA) will be diagonal Matrix &
   entries on diagonal line will be called as Singular Values
   
   => Singular Values will form a Middle Matrix

   Left Singular Matrix :
   ----
    - U
    -> set of left Singular Vectors

   Right Singular Matrix :
   ----
    - V
    -> set of right Singular Vectors

* Eigen Values vs Singular Values :
  ------------
   Eigen Value  Decomposition :- Eigen Values as a Diagonal in Diagonal matrix
   Singular Value Decompositon :- Singular Value as a Diagonal in Diagonal Matrix

   Si^2 / n-1 = LAMA_i

   Eigen val of S :- lama_i
   Sinngular val of X :- S_i

   In case of SVD :-

   Ui :- ith Column of U :- ith Eigen Vec of X*X^T
   Vi :- ith column of V :- ith Eigenn Vec of X^T*X

* NMF (Non-Negative Matrix Factorization)
  -------------
   -> Decompose Matrix into product of 2 Matrix s.t all the elements in both the matrix is >= 0

      A = B * C^T   

         - A is n*m dimen
           B is n*d dimen
           C is m*d dimen

         S.T. Bij >= 0 & Cij >= 0


-------------

* NMF & Regularization :
  -----------
   -> If you want to factorize in more sparse Matrices then provide more weight to L1-Norm in Elastic Net
