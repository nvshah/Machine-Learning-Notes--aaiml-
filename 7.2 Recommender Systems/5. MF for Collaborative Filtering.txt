REMEMBER : 

-> Matrix Factorization is used in Collobaritve Filtering to predict the unavailble ratings
   via using the available ratings

- Completed matrix :- Approximation to Incompleted Matrix via Optimization & Decomposition


----------

* MF for Collaborative Filtering
  ------

  Goal :- Fill the values using exisiting values

  Idea :- use the information (ie A_ij) available from given matrix to predict the information for
          unavailable cells

          Use the ratings provided by the users for movies to predict the ratings for unseen movies 
          by those users

          ( & then based on that we can prefer/suggest the movies with highest predicted ratings to corresp users)
----

* Let matrix between user & Item ie Ratings be A

  NOTE :- matrix is sparse i.e there are mmany empty cells

  Let A be decomposed into product of 2 Matrix s.t. 

     A = B * C^T   
        - where B :- n*d dimen
                C :- m*d dimen
                A :- n*m dimen

          where d > 0 & d <= m & d <= n


     A_ij = Bi^T * Cj 
        - where Bi^T :- ith row of B matrix
                Cj   :- jth row of C matrix

    So to Find B & C we can use optimization technique

* Optimization Problem :
  ----
    => Fill or predict the values using Optimization Problem

   	argmin Sum(A_ij - Bi^T * Cj)^2

   	     - where i,j s.t. A_ij is not empty

   	We need to find full B & C matrix

   	-> Ideally we want A_ij = Bi^T * Cj  // So diff between them is error

    => So instead of using all the cells of A_ij we are using only the one which are non-empty
       & 
       We are trying to minimize the Square-Loss for them

    => If this optimization is not very hard or NP-hard then we can solve it using Stochastic Gradient Descent method

    So SGD can be use to solve above Optimization problem

    Step-1) Find Bi & Cj for corresp non-empty A_ij
              \
               via optimization technique (such as SGD)
               NOTE :- here instead of scalar val we are finding optimal vectors

    Step-2) Form B & C matrix from Bi & Cj
                \
                 B -> n * d dimen
                 C -> m * d dimen
     
    Step-3) Now form new Matrix A_hat = B * C^T
           
          Completed Matrix
                 This new matrix {A_hat} is called as Completed Matrix
               
               - Initially {A} is sparse matrix i.e many cells are empty ie So its not completed matrix

               So we use Decomposition + Optimization Problem Technique to approximate the Completed Matrix for {A} ie {A`} using the non-empty cells in original A

* Matrix Factorization Optimization Model :
  ----------
   -> Use to predict the empty cells in Matrix A (of user-item interaction) via approximating the completed matrix

   A -> actual ratings
   A` -> predicted ratings  // completed matrix

   Model says :- break the actual Matrix A into product of 2 Matrix ie
      \
       -> A := B * C^T
            &
          Try to Fill the values using the optimization problem i.e A`s

Thus :-
  -> Matrix Factorization is used in Collobaritve Filtering to predict the unavailble ratings
   via using the available ratings
