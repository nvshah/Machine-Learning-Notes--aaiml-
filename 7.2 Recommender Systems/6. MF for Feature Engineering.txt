- In Matrix Decomposition of User-Item Matrix A :- n * m dimen
     We have 2 matrix : B :- n * d dimen
                        C :- m * d dimen
     
     [d is kinda hyper-param]
     
     Here d can be any val ie It's feature count for individual User & Item 
         \
          d > 0 & d < min(m,n)

     If 2 user vector Ui are same then their dist(ui, uj) will be small
     If 2 item vector Ii are same then their dist(Ii,, Ij) will be small
