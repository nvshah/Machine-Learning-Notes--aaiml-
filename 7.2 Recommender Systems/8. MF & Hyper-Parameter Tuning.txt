* MF & Hyper-Parameter Tuning
  -----	
   in MF :- A -> B * C

            A :- n*m
            B :- n*d
            C :- m*d

            d > 0
            d <= min(n,m)

   So d is hyper-parameter here

Q) How to choose good d ??

1) Problem/Task Specific :
   ----------


2) Systematic Way :
   ---------
    - take help of Loss Func :- A - B_transpose  * C   // Error term or Squared Err term

    - plot the error vs d graph
       \
        Find the point or inflection pt s.t. 

    Inflection Pt :- pt before which error reduces fastly with increase in d
                        after which error reduces slowly with increase in d

    -> Good tradeoff corresponds to the inflection point


    Another way to find the good inflectionn point is via Gradient :

 * Gradient & TradeOff :
   -----
     - Gradient / Slope 
     ->  rate of change in error w.r.t change in {d} ie dimen
