Q) Singular Value & Eigen Value relation ??
   How the singular values of non-squared matrix can be relate to eigen values of squared matrix
   In fact if both Matrix ie Squared & Rectangle are independent then how one values drives another ??
    \
     Si^2/(n-1) = lama^2


Q) How L1 Regularization Creates Sparsity ??
   
   What is Conceptual Difference between L1 & L2 Regularization ??


Q) Truncated SVD
   In Word Vector & MF ??
   
   why we do not consider Eigen Decomposition (beware Co-Occurence Matrix is Square Matrix)
   & 
   Why we go for SVD ??

Q) How we will consider Regularization Terms whilst accounting Optimization Problem as a Matrix Factorization way

   (Reverse of MF as an Optimization Problem) :-
