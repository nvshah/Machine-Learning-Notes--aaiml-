* MF & Clustering
  ---------------

* K-means : 
  ----
   -> find clusters & their centroids

   So We will have 1 set of clusters ie K = [k1, k2, ..., kn]
                   &
                   corresp set of cenntroids C = [c1, c2, ..., cn]

   Inorder to convert the CLustering problem to MF :-
     \
      We will create a Matrix of n-pts & k-clusters ie k*n

      where each cell denotes 

          - if Z_ij = 1 if n_i pt belong to k_j cluster (having c_j as centroid)
                    = 0 if not

   Given 3 matrices :

     1) X -> set of user(data)-pt vectors   // each pt vector is column vector

     2) C -> set of centroid vectors  // each centroid vector is column vector
             (Matrix formed by Cluster Centroids)

     3) Z -> Z_ij : 1  // Xj belongs to Ci
                    0  // not 

             (Matrix of which point belong to which cluster)

     Special Property of Z :- 
         in any column of it only enntry will be 1 else all 0 
         (ie a pt can belong to only one cluster at a time)

         ie Sum of column of Z must be 1

   goal :- We will decompose X into product of 2 matrices 

              s.t. X = C*Z   <- Objective
                   \
                    Above Matrix Factorization is equivalent(approximation to) 
                       :- min (X - C*Z)^2

                    S.T. Zij = 1 or 0  // this is hard part


=> So we have converted Original Problem formulation from (Vectors & Scalars) into Form of (Matrix)

Matrix Problem Formulation :-
___________________
   
   minimize :- (X - C*Z)^2   =>  X = C*Z   // approximation via Factorization
                  
                  s.T :- 1) Zij = 0 or 1
                         2) Sum of Zj = 1


* So k-means as Matrix Factorization step :
  --------
   -> Given a Matrix of Data Points, X
        break it into product of 2 Matrices (ie Matrix Factorization)

      K-means = MF + col-constraints + 0-1 constraints (Z)

      Thus if there are no contsraints then k-means would simply be Matrix Factorization Optimizationn problem

----------------

Thus MF :-  C * Z
     NMF :- Cij >= 0 & Zij >= 0

     K-means :- MF + col-constraints + 0-1 constraints
                 \
                  Zij = 0 or 1 & col-sum of Zj = 1
