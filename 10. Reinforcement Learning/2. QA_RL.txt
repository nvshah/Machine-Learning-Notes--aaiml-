-> Q(S, a) is what maximized when you compute value func V(s)

-> Depending on Value Func V(s), you can define your policy

=> Roomba is Robotic that did household kinda works

-> Lots of Autonomous Drones also used Reinforcement Learning

=> In ML & DL its minimizing Loss Func
   In RL its maximizing the Rewards
