=> use dir() to see the attributes on obj


Python OOP concept

-> The script invoked directlt is considered to be __main__ module
   so the default module is __main__  (which do not require to be imported in self script)

private members :- __pName
------------
 \
  -> name mangling :- _ClassName__pName
  - private members cant be access inside subclasses as well

Protected members :- _p

=> object is base class for all objects in python

object class :- __new__, __init__, __str__

* Multiple Inheritance :
  -----------
   MRO :- depth first & left->right 
         nOTE :- not searching when there is overlap in hierarchy

   Deadly Diamond

* Polymorphism ;
  -------
   Operator Level Polymorphism
   Function Level Polymorphism  (dynamic)

* No Overloading in Python OOP :
  ----
   -> Only Overriding

   Overloading can bee achieved via dispatcher
