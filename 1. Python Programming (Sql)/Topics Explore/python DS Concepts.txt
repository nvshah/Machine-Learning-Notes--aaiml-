When to use Which Data Structure ?

* Numpy :

   -> C/C++
   -> Homogenoues Data only so faster


* How to build tinyUrls ??
  --
   Given the Long URL -> provide the short URL 

   Given short URL -> provide the Long URL  (from tinyUrl Server)

   Use Dict as we want as much fast as possible to get short URL from long URL

   How Long -> short urL ?? base 64 hashing algo
                            random variable length

   Query per Seconds


* Distributed Hash Table : (For Search)

   -> when dict too large to be stored in single machine	

   Elastic Search

   inverted Index :- words -> documents  :- Inverted distributed hash table 

   Redis & MemeCache :- General purpose Distributed hash Table
