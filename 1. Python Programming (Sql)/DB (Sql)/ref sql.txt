-----------------

There are six parts in the conceptual order of execution of a SELECT statement from the ANSI SQL standard or ISO SQL standard perspective. If all six parts exist, the sequence is the following:

The FROM part is executed first.
The WHERE or ON part is executed second.
The GROUP BY part is executed third.
The HAVING part is executed fourth.
The SELECT part is executed fifth.
The ORDER BY part is executed last.
