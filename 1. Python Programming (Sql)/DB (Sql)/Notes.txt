------
(TIPS)

- Always query those cols that are required  (i.e it would be faster than `*` i.e everything)
- OFFSET = Ignore/Skip (starting rows)
- Always be aware about NULL values in SQL, (as it has some special meaning)

- Sub Queries are more code readable than Join Queries

- Delete or Truncate only Removes Content of tables
  Drop removes entire table (with Structure)

- SQLite does not have DCL commands

-> *.*  (all tables of all databases )

_______________________________________________
( General Notes )

SQL = Declarative => What you want !! 
                     Not How you want !?


-> Primary key, 
   Foreign key
   != , <>  // not equal to
   NULL => doesn't exist | missing
   IN

   Join Keywords -> {ON, USING}

 * example Imdb Schema -> Imdb dataset (movie, director, etc...)

 => root is the most powerful user  [root = database administrator]

* key => {PRI, MUL}

=> Simple `Select Query` will preserves the Row-Order
   Output row-order may vary in case of `Order By` query

=> Distinct consider all columns at same time (i.e treating as row & not chunks)

* `=` does not works with `NULL`.  use `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL` instead. 

=> Group-By often used with aggregated function
   Ig grouping columns containing null values, all Null values resorts to 1 i.e grouped together


* Having
-----
=> Having is often used with Group By,
   but it's not manadatory
   in which case it will act as `Where` condition

   Having is applied on top of groups & not on individual rows
=> Having is applied after grouping whereas Where is used before grouping

* Join :
----
=> Not required `ON` keyword syntax whilst Natural Join

   Inner Join = Join
   Left Join = Left Outer join
   Full Join = Full Outer Join

* DataTypes :
----
 -> XML & Json are widely used to store & transmit data among internet

Terminologies 
----------

=> result-set : a set of rows that form a result of a query alongwith col-names & metadata	

-> Logical Operators

=> aggregate-func : perform some operation on set of rows & return aggregated values

=> Alias : another name for column produce by aggregated fun
           
        -> We can use alias just to refer same thing in further part of Query

=> Join : help us to combine data that are splitted among multiple tables
    
     Natural Join :- When same cols-name between splitter tables. `USING` is optional
     Inner Join   :-  `ON`
     
     Outer join :- {left, right, full}

=> Sub Queries : Alternatives to Join (to work & get data from inter-dependent tables) 
                 Inner-Most to Outer-Most

    Exists : -> result set is not an empty set (atleast 1 row)

   Correlated Sub-Queries : Here for each row sub-query is run again
                            Outer-Most to Inner-Most


 * Data Manipulation Language :
   ----------------------
    SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

    Insert :
     ----
      1) Insert Single/Multiple Rows
      2) Insert from another table

 * Data Definition Lanaguage :
   ----------------------
    CREATE
       \
        DataType, Constraints 
        
        Type  :-  INT, VARCHAR
        Constraints :- (i.e PRIMARY, NOT NULL, UNIQUE, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK, INDEX)
     SQL Data types 

    ALTER 
      \
      MODIFY   
    => With Alter you can add, remove or modify column data, datatype or Constraints

    DROP 
      -> removes entriee table (alongwith table structure)


 * Data Control Language (DCL)
   --------------------
    -> Control type of access of an user to DB  
    -> ensure data safety 
    -> properly maintained by DB Admin whilst being used by diff engineers with diff access
    -> Admin controls those premissions

    2 basic Commands -> { GRANT, REVOKE }

    Database creator can create role (alike admin)
    - Assign some permissions to Role
    - role can be assign to multiple users

* Temporary Tables
