* Collaborative Filtering RS :
  -------

   -> Inorder to do RS, we need Some Features for User Vector & Item Vector
      to compare them

      So we will use User & Movie Pair & Fetch out some stats & info that can be used as Feature

      NOTE :- Only user & Movie info will contribute to the Feature Formation (Featurization)
            - Ratings will be used as predictor (ie To be predicted entity)

* Surprise Models :
  ----
   -> Esp lib used for RS kinda tasks 

* Modeling :
  ----
   Final Model := XgBoost

   -> Before that various Susrpise models are used in Manual Ensembling Fashion 
      ie 
      Output of each Surprise model will become a Feature to Final Model 

   -> Surprise Model are specifically used for MF (ie RS)
