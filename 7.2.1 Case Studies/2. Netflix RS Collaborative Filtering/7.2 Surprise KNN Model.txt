7.2 Surprise KNN Model

Tip :- Play around with Hyper-Param to get deal with Overfitting !

____________

KNN Surprise Model : 
  - introduce features which are very similar intutively to what we found whilst Top-13 Features 

  - Analogy to Features we found via Manually during top-13 Features
    Top 13 Feat :- founded manually
    This time  :- we will find via Model from Surprise

    Concept intutively is same among both


=> KNN Eqn : (user-User Similarity)
   -----
    -> KNN Surprise Model helps to find the (user-user sim)
    -> It uses baseline model & additive terms 

    - Take all the users v who are very similar to user u for movie rating i
        \
         k most similar users to curr user(u)

    Similarity :
    ---
     - Cosine or Pearson Coef Correlation can be used
     - between all user & curr user that has rated similar movie ie movie(i)

    Deviation : (in baseline model)
    ----
     - How wrong is ratings from baseline model is also accounted in KNN Surprise model
       (r_vi - b_vi)

    Shrunkage pearson Correlation Coef :
    -----------
     -> Its alike Laplace Smoothing
     -> to make Pearson Coef more smooth

    Obsv :- some overfitting is observed


* KNN -> User-User Predictor
         Movie-Movie Predictor

* Updated Model :
  -----
   -> 13 Features + Baseline Model + KNN-baseline-User-user + KNN-baseline-Movie-Movie


* Feature Imp :
  ---------
   -> These Feature are not adding much imp because 
      We already have such kinda feature in model (ie during Computing top 13 Features)
