* Problem :- Given User & Movie & Ratings try to predict the movies for users

  Challange :- Netflix already havd `cinematch` performance eavaluated in terms of RMSE
               Netflix want it to be improved 


  Objective :-  
  ----
   - Predict the Ratings for User-Movie Pair (Given User-Movie Ratings Data)
   - Now Post predicting the ratings, user will be recommended the movie accordingly
   - So once User watch that recommended movie he/she will actually provide the ratings for that movie
   -> So now we have actual + predicted ratings
        - we can compute RMSE or MAPE like measures from it

   -> ratings range from 1 -> 5
   -  So this problem can be framed as MF or Regression Problem (both ways)

  Constraints :
  ---
   -> Interpretability : Why you recommend this movie to user (???)

  Low Latency
  ----
   - There is no must need for Low latency Requirement in this case
   - as we can precompute the results & cache it & provide it to user on next day
          (Eg Yesterday night we can precompute & recommend it on next day
              as user watch  max 2-3 movie per day)

   - So there is no explicit Low-Latency Requirement (So there is no Low latency Constraint)


* Pose as ML Problem :
  -------------
   - Standard RS problem
      \
       Multiple Approaches :- Item-Item Similarity
                              User-User Similarity
                              MF problem
   - It can also be imposed as Regression Problem
      \
       If Given Matrix we can Find Features somehow thenn we can use Regression as well
          
          D={xi, yi}  // yi ranges from 1 to 5
             - we need to find xi somehow based on ratings provided

   - MF + Regression + XGBoost => Problem as Solution


* Performance Metric :
  --------
   - RMSE (minimize it)
   - Try to provide interpretability
