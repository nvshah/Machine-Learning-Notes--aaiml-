7. Models Preparing
   ---------

NOTE :- All the model prep is happening on Sampled Train & Test Data & not actual data

- Metric :- { RMSE, MAPE }

TIP :- 
 When you do try with multiple models its imp to check which Feature are imp for particular Models (ie Feature Importance is helpful)
 [F-Score]

Given User Ui, Movie Mj :- 

1) Xgboost for First 13 Features :
   --------------------- 
    - The Most Imp Feature are { UserAvg, MovieAvg, ... }

2) Surprise baseline model :
   -------------------
   need to find :
    b_u  // kinda alike User_Avg
    b_i  // kinda alike Movie_Avg

    baseline model := global_avg + b_u + b_i
       \
        Similar to calc & finding kinda user_avg (b_u) & kinda movie_avg (b_i)
         via Optimization Problem

    Linear Models :
    ---
     Least Square Optimization problem : 
        - we will find efficent b_u & b_i  
        - Note : we will also add Regularization term in Optimization Problem Eqn


Idea :- Whatever Output we are getting from Diff Surprise Models will become the next feature in Out Updated Model

* First Model :
  ------
   Given  :- User Ui, Movie Mj  & Yi = ratings available
   &
   Features :- 1. 13 Feature calc manually
               2. 14th feature available as output of Surprise baseline Model Prediction

   Apply XGBoost for these features 

   => Feature Importance :
       - F-Score


* Baseline Surprise Model :
  ----
   (Optimization Problem)
   -> Introducing 2 Features Which are very similar to Movie Avg & User Avg
   -> Its much about finding the user avg & movie avg
