7.3 Matrix Factorization & Surprise Model
   --------
   -> Do MF using Surprise Library

* SURPRISE MODEL :
  -------------

* SVD Using Surprise Models : 
  ------------
   - need to find 4 things 
       - b_u, b_i  // scalars
       - p_u, q_i  // vectors 

   [Factors] :
   -> What should be the dimension of vectors p_u & q_i	
      factors = #dimension of p_u or q_i in SVD


   - Eqn Comprises of :- User Bias, Movie Bias, 
                         user Vector, movie vector
                         global rating stats


* SVD++ 
  -----
   - 1 more extra term in Equation (mathematically) compare to above SVD formulation

   Feedback is generally calculated from { user & movie } vector ie p_u & q_i
     \
      Implicit & Explicit

   Explicit Feedback :
    --- 
     User U give feedback/rating for Movie i :- Explicit Feedback
     - user watch the movie i (then only he can rate it)

   Implicit Feedback :
    ---
     User visit page that contains info about some Movie (not nnecessary user has Watch or rate that Movie)
       -> fact that User has visit & learn about Movie can be inferred as Implicit Feedback

     - user spent some time with movie 
       user consider of rating movie (irrespective he rated or not actually) - Implicit Feedback

     - user at some point interested in Movie

    |I_u|  -> cardinality of set of all movies rated by user u
    y_j    -> new set of item factors that capture implicit ratings 


* Hyper-param K :
  ------------

NOTE :- Big Hyperparameter is #factors ie k
    
 -> During SVD++ or SVD :
     ---
      If you select larger K (ie dimension of vectors of movie & item)
        \
         You can get lower RMSE values
