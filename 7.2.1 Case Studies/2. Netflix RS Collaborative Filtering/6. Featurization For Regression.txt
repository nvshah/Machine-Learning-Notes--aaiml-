6. Featurization For Regression
----------

-> For all Sampled Train & Test Data
   
   D_tr -> D_tr`

1. Find GLobal Average of all Movie Ratings
   Find Avg rating per user
                   per movie

=> Data we had at hand :- Ui, Mj, & Rij

* First 13 Features (Finding) 
  -------------------------
   -> We can use only Ui & Mj to find all the 13 Features 
      Thus Xi - vector will be of length 13 computed via info use avail from (Ui, Mj)

   -> Yi - is the Rij

  For User Ui & movie Mj :- Compute a Vector as below
  
  f1 = Global Avg
  f2 = User Avg
  f3 = Movie Avg

  f4-f8 :- Top 5 Similar User's Ratings to User Ui
  f9-f13 :- Top 5 similar movies rated by this user Ui


NOTE :- 
  when you compute for Test Data, You need to compute Similarity Keeping in mind the User's & movies available under Train Data only (You can't consider any n)

  You can't use test-users only

  So for new user in test data :- provide similar users values as 0
         new movie in test data :- provide similar vals as 0


* data transformation for Surprise :
  ------------------
   -> Surprise has its own way to load & store data to make it works fast

   => So you need to transform Your existing data (in Dataframe way) to way that `Surprise` needed
