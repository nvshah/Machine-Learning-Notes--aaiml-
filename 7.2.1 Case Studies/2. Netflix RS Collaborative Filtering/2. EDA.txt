2. EDA

-------------
-> IN ML, 90% of Experiments Usually Fail

--------------

* Prepare CSV :
  ---
   Row Format :- Mj, Ui, Rij, Date

  1) Describe Ratings Column
  2) Check nan
  3) Check for duplicated Rows
  4) Basic Stats (#movies, #users, #ratings)  // uniquely (high level Overview)


* Temporal Nature :
  -----
   -> You consider all data till today & prepare model tonight
      &
      You can then deploy model tomorrow for users

   Split Temporally
   -------------
   -> Temporal Nature whilst splitting the data for train-test split.
   -> 80% - Train 
      20% - test

   Note :- Data is sorted according to Date only


* EDA :
  ----

1) Distribution of Ratings 
2) Ratings over Month 
3) Ratings Given by each User
     - Check Mean Val
     - Check Diff Quantiles & Percenntiles Values 

4) For Given Movie Find Num of Users who rated the Movie
5) No. of Rating by Day of the Week

Q) Is the day of Week is an interesting feature to predict the rating for Movie

6) Box Plot :- 
     - If all box plot fully align (not much information via that Feature)

     DOW :- is not much good feature


* Sparse Matrix Representation :
  --------------------
   sparse.csr_matrix() 

   Note :- We need to create Sparse representation otherwise such Data Mmatrix would take lot of space on System.

   As Sparsity Increases -> Sparse Matrix Representation Matters a lot

  -> Data is extremely Sparse


* Stats :
  ----
   1) Global mean of All Ratings (Entire Ecosystem)
   2) User-Averages
   3) Movie-Averages

      User-Avg -> gives Idea abt if user is critical or Linenet
      Movie-Avg -> gives Idea abt if Movie is Popular or Average


* Cold Start Problem :
  ----------
   - Imp issue in RS

   :- There will be some users & movies in Test data part (ie Movie which were relaesed later)
      For which we will have no data available in Train part

   How many new users are there ??
   How many new Movies are there ?

   -> Cold start is fairly Severe with Users

   : 15% of user in Test do not have any ratingns earlier
   : 1.95% of movies in Test do not have corresp ratings in Train data
