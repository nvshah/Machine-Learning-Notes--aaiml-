5. Model Framing Techniques :
  ----------

1) Regression  2) Surprise (MF + RS)

1) Regression Framing :
   -------
    -> Given Ui, Mj we want to find some features so that we can use it to predict ratings Rij
       (Base Model)

2) Surprise Lib has many models :
   ---------
    - baselines, KNN, SVD, SVD++

 
* Stacking + Nested Boosting Technique :
  ----------
   XgBoost -> creates the baseline models iteratively

   Now We here also Do iteration to create diff XGBoost Models
   So What XGBoost does internally, Here its been emulated to create multiple XGBoost Models
   at diff level ??

   What XGBoost Does internally as a single model (ie creating multiple baseline models iteratively)
   here its been replicated to create multiple XGBoost Models 
     \
      ie at each stage we are finding new Model (with new Feature as consideration, whereas XgBoost try to fit to Pseudo-Errors)

 Que] Why do such way ?? What is motif & significance ??

* XgBoost Model :
  ---
   -> Diff Models at each iteration
   -> Output of these Models are given to XGBoost

   -> Thus its 

   Diff Features Set :-

     1) 13 Handcrafted Features
     2) baselines
     3) KNN - User-User
     4) KNN - Movie-Movie
     5) SVD
     6) SVD++	


* Sampling :
  ------
   Take some users-movies from Train 
   Take some users-movies from Test

   & Make Model from it

   (Note :- Inorder to learn Model in less time (on Single Box System) this sampling is done especially)
