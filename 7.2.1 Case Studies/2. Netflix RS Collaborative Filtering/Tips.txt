Tips

-> Always do Feature Imp When it involves exploring multiple models (ie kinda Ensemble techniques)
   Feature Imp vs Features bar Plot 
     \
      F-Score

-> As you do more hyper-parameter tuning The Better results you will get

=> As long as you add more features, There should be improvement in Model (ie consider Boosting technique is used)
   If it not thenn there must be something need attention with Hyper-parammeter Tuning (properly do HyperParm Tuning)
