1. Music RS Part 1
-----------------

- Gaana or Spotify 
   
   -> no static data. ie data is dynamic in nature

* Aim :
  ---
   - Recommend Stream of Songs

* Data :-
  ---
   1 million songs + 1000 new songs per week
   10 million users / listeners

* Informationn :
  -----

   1. Listens :- Ui, Sj, time_ij  // User_i listens Sound Sj for duratiomn of time_ij

   2. Up & Down Votes :- Ui, Sj, +1 / -1, timestamp

   3. User Playlists :- Ui, Pk   // Pk is set of songs

   4. User Profile Data :- {name, gender, age, location(ip address), isPaidUser}

   Note :
     - Voting data is sparse (ie not all users do vote)
     - Playlist data is also sparse (ie few users create playlist)



* Biz- Problem :
  -----
   -> Recommend Songs (like radio) // ie continuous sequence of Songs

   - Realtime, Adaptive, Continuous Learning

       Adaptive :- User Patterns of Listening Song in Sequence

       Continuous Learning :- If user Skip any song & move to next song then System should learn it
                              You will get Skipped Song Information as (Ui, Sj, isSkipped)

* Low-Latecy :- next song should come in under 1 sec when youy play some song !

* Biz-Metric  (Ask 1st Que in any Business Problem )
  ------
   -> Biz-metric is smthng that you can explain to Business Mmanager 
        (ie in Layman term or simple terms )

   -> # number of recommended song listen per user (per day)
      or
      # % of recommended sonng listen by user

* Biz-Problem-Formulation (Pose):
  -------

   Clasif is problem for Run-Time :
     -> prob for all songs ie Sj for single user Ui

  1) Song-Song Similarity :
   
  2) User-User similarity

  3) Song Vectorization using Deep Learning !

      - Remove Songs that are dissimilar & keep that are Similar (not Skipped in between)


- NOTE :- Songs are very Subjective :
          Eg Let Say some Song S6 is similar to Song S1 & also to S2

             Now let say User Listens Recommonded Song S1 
                 but Skip Song S2 after hearing for 15 seconds

                 then next Song S3 in row must be s.t 
                        It's Similar to S1 & 
                        at same time dissimilar to S2

                 So if S6 is recommended in Row (as next) then its not good recommendation as 
                 User Skip Song S2 before !
                 otherwise if user not Ski S2 then its will Work

* FAISS (FB) 
  ------
   - a mechanism that be used to help to get Similar Song
