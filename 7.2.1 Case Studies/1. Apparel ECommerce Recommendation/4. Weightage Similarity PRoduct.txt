* Weightage Similarity Product (Brand & Color)
  _________________

  Idea ::- Weightage Eucledian Distance (Title + Brand + Colors)

-> Till now we have just check the Title feature for Product Similarity 
   Now we will Consider Brands & Colors as well

   Title -> Vector (300 Dimens) via Idf-W2V

* Brands & Colors :
  ------
   get vector for Brands & Colors via 1-hot encoding

* Product Vector :
  -------
   - Combine all the vectors (horizontally)
      \
       Title + Brands + Colors

* Weightage Product Vector :
  -------
   - Sometimes you want to specifically recommend based on color or brand 
      \
       in such case just provide the weightage accordingly to title, brand, color in product vector


Code :- [9.6] => Weightage Similarity using brand & color


* Try with diff weights :
  -----------

  More Weights => More Preference

  1) Title :- Weights = 5
     extra (brand & color) :- weights := 5

  2) Title :- Weights = 5
     extra (brand & color) :- weights := 50

     // Lot of Importance to Brand & Color for Similarity
