6. Deep Learning ConvNets
 -------------------


* Image -> Vec :
  --------
   Image has several Features such as :- 
     - Edges
     - Shapes
     - Colors
     - Patterns

* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) :
  ---------
   -> State of the Art Technique for Image -> Vec  // via Deep learning


  Building CNN takes lots of Efforts & its not trivial

  So some companies like Google, Amazon has build already their own CNN

    - AlexNet
    - GoogleNet
    - ResNet	
    - VGG

=> Understanding CNN & how it works internally is not trivial (its fairly complex)


Recommendation only via Images (CNN):
--------
Consider :-
  => Only use Images to find Similar Products instead of using (Title + Colors + Brands)

Visual Features Based Product Similarity 

-> Note traind features from VGGNet are stored in .npy ie numpy files
