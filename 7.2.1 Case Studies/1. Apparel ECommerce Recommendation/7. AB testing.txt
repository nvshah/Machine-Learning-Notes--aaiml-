7. AB testing (Bucket Testing)
  ---------------

  Algorithms + Business Rules = Solution to market

-> Let Say we have 2 Solutions
   
   You have to make soln run on million of products !

Q) How would you say that solution 1 is better than solution 2, Quantitatively not subjectively ?? 
   
  -> AB testing 

* A/B testing :
  -----
   Core Idea :- break users into 2 portion & try 2 soln on each portion & compare then 

     Eg - Drug/Medicine testing

   -> You can try 100 of algorithms
