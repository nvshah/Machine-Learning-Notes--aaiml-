Q1) Why to perform Col-Standardization before Model Preparation in KNN 

 -> Since Euc-Dist gets affected by Scale, Perform the Col-Standardization before performing KNN
    (As KNN uses distance underhood)

    Diff Scale have diff undue impact 
    	Eg Tortoise & Rabbit 


Q2) Why Sigmoid Func in Log-Reg ??

 -> As Sigma Func is easy to differentiate 
                \
                 -> { tappering-linear behaviour, probabilistic interpretation }


Q3) Why pseudo-residuals to approximate residual/error ?

 -> simplifying assumption i.e -ve of grad() = similar to error

    Matehamtical Proof & intution :-
    

Q4) Why for Very High Dimen Features, Linear Model are preferred ??
  
  -> because for very high dimen, #hyper-planes choices are more 
     &
     Hyper-plane can easily seperate points 

     So Linear Model like Linear Reg & Logistic Reg are preferred


Q5) Why do Normalization/Standardization prior to Dimen-Reduction ??
