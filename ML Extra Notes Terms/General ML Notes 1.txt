General ML Notes

-> In ML model & featurization are inter-related

-> Domain Knowledge & Feature Engineering are equally imp in ML as framing a Model/Aglo

-> To make your model Robust 
     we can employ :- Generalization via Regularization
                      RANSAC
                      Local Outlier Factor (LOF)

-> Productionization Model :- High ThroughPut & Low-Latency Application

-> Temporal Nature of Data :- Change over time  // consider it using train-test-split

-> Cross Validations is more trustworthy than the domain knowledge

-> Image-Data has pixels & those pixels have spatial-property (ie Spatial-Coherence)
   ie Pixel surrounding to it are somewhat related or similar to it

[IMP]
-> A/B testing is only truth that your Business/Manager Accepts !!
      \
       -> GOld Standaard Rule for testing actually in real world


-> Domain Knowledge based Validation

[IMP]
=> The context of Low-Latency changes based on whether you are doing preditcions 
   or whether you are doing Training

[Real Time & Low latency] :-
 -> For training of Model, Real-Time doesn't mean milliseconds,
    It may go upto minutes (ie let say 10 mins as well)
