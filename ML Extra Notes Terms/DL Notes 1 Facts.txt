DL Notes 1 Facts

-> DL works well for Image & Time-Series data

-> Today's state of the art is deep-learned features   
      (whether it may be Image Recog or Medicinal Application

=> `Haar` features are one of the advance Image Processing Features

=> Best way to learn Time Series Data is LSTM
=> Best way to learn the Image Data is CNN Deep Learning Algo

-> deep learning techniques are data hungry

=> For Back-Propogation Algo, Your Activation Function needs to be Differentiable.

[*IMP*]
=> You can think MLP as Multi layer generalization of Linear Regression or Logistic Regression 

=> Compute Cost vs Performance Tradeoff becomes very Severe for Deep Leanring

    Most Imp TradeOff for DL is Compute vs Performance
