classification notes

- Linear Shape
- Non Linear Shape

* Hyper-Parameters :
  --------
   parameter that decide how your model is going to perform
   parameter that decide High-Bias (underfitting) - High - Variance (Overfitting) tradeoff

   We determine Hyper-Param using CV

 => Hinge Loss has small problem i.e at Hinge its not differentiable (i.e at Zi=1 probably)



* RF :- Random Forest works well on Tabular Data
