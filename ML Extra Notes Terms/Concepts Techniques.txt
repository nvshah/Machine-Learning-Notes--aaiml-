Concepts Techniques

* Optimization Problem :
  ----
   Loss Func

   1) GD    (Gradient Descent)
   2) SGD   (Stochastic GD)
   3) MF    (Matrix Factorizations)
   4) ALS  (alternatinng Least Squares)

   => Always use regularization term whilst solving loss func for optimization problem

   1) Regularization Term
   2) Biased Term
   3) Mean Term 


* Underfitting & Overfitting :
  -----
   Underfittting :
      -> Too Simple
      -> not trying ennough to utilise the features available at hand to learn
          or
         features available at hand are not enough for preparingn good model

      -> Regularization term in Optimization Problem Eqn is somewhat related to Underfitting & in
         Favour to Underfitting

      -> So When Model is Underfitted you cann try reducing the Regularization param as well sometime
