Mathematics concept terms

-> Feynman method of integration

-> Rectangular method
   Trapezoidal Method  (both to find AUC)

-> Equations :- Line, Circle

-> Monte Carlo Approaches (Random number)

-> Plane :- Intercept & Normal to Plane

-> Hidden Markov Models

----------------------

=> We've seen That Area of Shape We can utilise 2 methods :-
   
    - 1) AUC via Rectangular or Trapezoidal
      2) Monte Carlo method (via Randomization & Sampling)
      3) Approximation using Polygon

=> Type of Function :
     
     Monotonic Func     // Optimization Problem
     Sigmoid Func       // Log-Reg
     Logarithmic Func   // General
     Exponential Func   // General (inverse of Log-Func)
     Power-Law          // Pareto distb
