2. Maxima & Minima

-> Solving eqn is nit always trivial

=> At both minima & maxima the slope becomes 0
    \
     df/dx = 0   // as slope is df/dx

Q) Maxima or Minima ?
   ---------------
  -> one of the simplest way to determine if gradient is maxima or minima is 
     to take nearest point of optima, after solving df/dx

       Step 1) df/dx = 0  // solve & find x
       step 2) take point near to x to determine if x is maxima or minima

  - It may possible that function may have 
  		- only either maxima or minima
    	- neither have maxima nor minima
    	- multiple maxima & multiple minima (but 1 global maxima/minima)


 * Local Minima/maxima :
   -------
    - W.r.t locality or neighborhood there is minima/maxima

   Global Minima/Maxima :
   -------
    - Amongst all its minima/maxima


-> Minima/maxima are not always trivial to be found out
    - sometimes solving such eqn becomes non-trivial (not easy)

    So when its hard to find df/dx = 0

    	- In such case we can use techniques such as gradient Descent (An iterative + Computational approach)
