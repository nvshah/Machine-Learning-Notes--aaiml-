3. Vector Caclulus :
  
----------

TIP : 

=> It's easy to understand the Vector Calculus using Scalar Calculus equivalent

------------

-> Till now we have seen x & f(x),  where x is scalar

But whole of Machine Learning is about vectors so that we can work on high dimensions

x : vector :- high-dimen space

* Vector Differentiation :
  -----------
   - Grad or Del 
   - vector instead of scalar

   speak :- Grad of F w.r.t v  // where F is function of a vector v

   * Partial Derivative
     ---
      - function f() is terms of multiple variables i.e dependent on vector & not a scalar

        When we take derivative of such function w.r.t vector we will get another vector
        with members as partial derivative term

   REMEMBER : this Behaves same way but only thing is that variable is now vector innstead of a scalar

   solving dF/dv = 0  sometimes is not trivial
