* Single Variable differentiation :
  ---------
   -> rate of change of y w.r.t x = dy/dx = tan(theta)

   -> as dx -> 0, line/hypotaneous becomes tangent i.e point

   Tangent :- 
      -> line that touches plane exactly at 1 point
      -> hypotaneous we obtained as dx -> 0

   As delat(x) -> 0, delta(y)/delta(x) => dy/dx

   -> dy/dx = slope of a tangent with X-Axis          // geometrically
   				ie angle that slope make with x-axis

   => tan(theta) = slope 
                 = angle between tangent & X-Axis


   * Gradient of Func :
     ---
      -> derivative of func = Gradient of that func
