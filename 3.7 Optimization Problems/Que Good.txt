* How to know any funcntion is Differenntiable or not ?

-> Function has to be Continuous 
   Its not nnecessary that if Function is Continuous then its Differentiable

   Function has to be Smooth -> Slope Do not change eradically

   If a slope changes instantly (ie let say from -1 to +1) -> then its not continuous at some point

=> So Differentiability defines the First Derivative of Func has to be Continuous


* Continuous  :
  -----
   Means that Function line should be connected by all dots
   There should not be any point where function is not defined !

* Differentiability :
  -----
   -> Tells us if First Derivative is Continuois or not !


-> A Function may be Continnuous but not Differentiable 


* PieceWise Function :
  -------
   We can define abs val of x via Peice Wise Func
