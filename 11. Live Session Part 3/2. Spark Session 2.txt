----

=> Spark uses Directed Acyclic Graph DS

----------

AWS EMR -> can provide Spark Cluster or Hadoop Cluster
Azure Databricks

For Learning its better to setup Spark on SingleBox (via AWS)
- Docker based Containers
- on Linux/Mac/Windows <- install Spark

=> Majorly Production system uses Linux System

* Docker :
  - Sits on top of OS
  - Creates a virtualization

  Now if we open Jupyter NB (via token) from Docker, then its running on pySpark + Jupyter
  If I open localhost:8888 in my browser then its pointing to Jupyter NB from Docker

----

* Compute value of PI (using Monte Carlo Approch)


=> Dataframe is inspired from SQL
=> MLLib is inspired from Sklearn

=> Spark can distribute jobs not only on CPUs but also on GPUs
   (But You need very fast inter-connnect between Computers)
