* Ratios + Offset + Percentile

 -> If ratio of 2 fraction is same 
     & 
    if you add the offset to numerator of 2 fractions 
    then the 
    Fraction with smaller (numerator & denominator) will impacted/affected more than larger (numerator & denominator)

    Why ??-> because percentile of of both fraction vary at each point 
            \
             ie smaller one will reach towards/move away from median faster than 
                larger one would be

                So impact on smaller one is high

Let say ratios :- 
   
   s1 = 2/100  = 2 %
   b1 = 18/900 = 2 %

   let say offset = 10 

     so s1 = (2+10)/100 = 10 %
        b1 = (18+10)/100 = 3.04 %

   Thus s1 turn from 2 -> 10
        b1           2 -> 3.04


* Linear vs Quadratic Eqn :
  ----------------
   Linear : exponent 1
   quadratic : exponent 2

   Quadratic Func has squared term + linear term + constants


* Convex Polygon : Polygon where all points lie on or inside that polygon
   ------
     \
      -> Convex Hull Idea & Concept


* tangent :
  ------
   -> Tangent helps us to find the slope of function at particular instance 


* Distance of Origin from Plane ??
  --------
   Plane : W^T*X + b = 0
   
   -> b // W


* Jaccard Distance :
  --------
   -> helps to analyse how 2 sets are similar to each other 

* Norm :
  -----
   L1 Norm
   L2 Norm

   Frobenius Norm (for Matrix)


* Sparse vs Dense :
  ----------

   Dot Product of Sparse Vector :
   ------
    -> Only connsiders the non-zero value between 2 vector & do computation

   Dot Product of Dense Vector :
   ------
    -> Do Computation on Entire vectors
