* Monotonic Func Rule :
  -----------
	If g(x) is a monotonic function
	        \
	         then argmin(f(x)) = argmin(g(f(x)))
	              argmax(f(x)) = argmax(g(f(x)))

* Optimization Rule :
  -----------
	In Optimization :
	  The x that minimizes f(x) is the same that maximizes -f(x)

=> Computing logs take more time complexity than computing squares


* Basic Property PMF R.V :
  -------
   For Discrete R.V & its PMF
      \
       -> The sum(P(x)) = 1


* For sets similarity we have diff techniques : 
  1) Jaccard Distance 
  2) Otsuha Ochiai Coeff (Cosine dist alike)
  
  3) Adam / Adar Index ( For Directed Graph)


* Monnte Carlo simulations :
