Math Notes 1

-> e is constant i.e called base of natural logarithm

-> Distributions are preferred over Percentile Models as they are more precise

=> Random Numbers are related with 2 topics Monte Carlo Approach & Uniform Distribution

=> Log is called a monotonnic function
   Log doesn't change the Order

-> F(x) = X^2  is a Parabola

* Monotonic Function :
  -------
   -> as x is incr f(x) also incr

* Sparse Matrix :
  -------
   -> Matrix where any row contains most of element of 0/useless
   -> i.e Matrix that has most of its rows as sparse vectors

* Sparse Vector :
  ------
   -> Vector that contains lots of elements as useless info/0

  Sparsity of Matrix :
    -> percent of non-useful cell (i.e zero cell) in a total cell

* distance vs Norm :
  -------------
   - distance between points & norm for a vector

* Polarity : (+ve/-ve)

* Hyper-plane is all abt defining its Normal (Vector)

* Density :- # points in unit area  | if more than more dense else less dense

* If numerator or denominator in original likelihood is small then you have less confidence abt the 
  ratio
  (As ratio are easily corrupted when you have small vals in numerator or denominator)

* Log converts the multiplication into addition
                    exponentiation into multiplication

* If plane passes through origin, intercept in plane = 0

=> For a Monotonic Func the point that minimzes the f(x) is the same that maximizes the -f(x)
   argmin(f(x)) = argmax(-f(x))

=> For func to be differentiable It needs to be continuous
   non-continuous = non-differentiable

=> Only smooth continuous curves can be differentiable

* Colinear :
  --------
   representing 

=> Dot Product = Cosine Similarity (assuming norm =1)

- euler number = 2.78

-> Computing logs take more time complexity than computing squares
